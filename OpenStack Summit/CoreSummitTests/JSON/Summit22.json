      "description": "<p>NUMA topology in storage for OpenStack provide high-level control which\u00a0help users minimize latency and maximize performance. According to our experience, users are keen to know how to\u00a0make Ceph run faster for I\/O intensive workloads. Many companies are looking for Ceph that can provide high IOPS to run databases or mission critical applications. In order to achieve certain IOPS per Ceph cluster, the con\ufb01guration of Ceph parameters, PCIe SSDs and hardware plays a critical role. It also drives the demand of the server with NUMA design, which bene\ufb01ts the Ceph performance and lowers the latency.<\/p>\n<p>In this session, we'll share performance analysis and \ufb01ndings of all-\ufb02ash Ceph on a NUMA-balanced server\u00a0when running MySQL workloads. You will learn how a server design and con\ufb01gurations affect the Ceph performance and best practices to con\ufb01gure IOPS-optimized Ceph for OpenStack.<\/p>",

Typically, the application is restricted to using the node's software libraries and compiler toolchain. In our experience this compute model causes the development environment on the HPC cluster and the user's desktop to differ, adding obstacles to software development. In addition, cluster software upgrades potentially alter the application's runtime behavior or results.<\/p>\r\n<p>From our point of view the&nbsp;provisioning of virtual machines in&nbsp;OpenStack offers a user friendly alternative. But how does a scientific application perform on OpenStack?<\/p>\r\n<p>Here we run a quantum chemistry application employing novel computational algorithms written in Fortran and MPI and investigate the changes necessary in the work flow and the application code and the impact of virtualization on performance and parallel scalability.<\/p>",

Over the past 18 months logs have helped troubleshoot each layer: hardware, OpenStack, and VNF. OpenStack log use cases range from monitoring virtual infrastructure health to correlating details about an interface going down and network elements affected by the outage. Future use cases include security audits and providing confirmation of network activities. A challenge with OpenStack logs is that key logs may be at various severities, including \"debug\", and setting severity to \"debug\" in production results in a large volume of logs, taxing resources. Approaches that Verizon Wireless and SevOne have taken to address this challenge include log filtering, indexing, tagging, compression, and distributed processing.<\/p>",

It is constantly growing, constantly evolving, and companies are constantly changing the way they want to interact with it. To sustain and manage the customer demand Expedient had to get creative in how they store customer data. Running PB of block storage to run VM's and Containers was easy but customers are demanding programmable storage via a S3 API. Which presents a whole new set of challenges especially when you have to interact with both modes of IT, traditional and cloud.<\/p>\n<p>To meet customers needs, Expedient leveraged OpenStack Swift(SwiftStack version) to provide that API driven storage. See the blue prints we used to build our offering, learn about how our customers are adopting it, and hear our experiences after operating this platform for two years.

      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">The oslo.messaging library supports the concept of service-specific transports (e.g. backends) to allow RPC and Notification services to employ different messaging technologies. The need for this dual messaging backend capability is driven by the limitations of broker-based messaging for RPC communications with regard to complexity, scalability and resiliency. The temporal coupling of OpenStack service RPC communications favors a brokerless message bus based on direct messaging capabilities rather than queuing. Meanwhile, the operation of Notification services remain best served by a broker based \"store and forward\" messaging bus. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">This presentation will review the oslo.messaging RPC and Notification services and the operation of brokerless and broker-based messaging backends. The steps to configure and operate dual messaging backends will be demonstrated. An explanation of how high availability and cloud distribution can be realized will be provided. <\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Many NFV use cases (i.e.\u00a0vCPE, vBRAS and vBNG), all require dynamic scaling, agile resource balancing, and geo redundancy across multiple PoPs (Point of Presence).\u00a0 We argue that the current OpenStack platform does not handle network dynamics well because its resource allocation is not network-aware but compute-centric. To overcome this, the network fabric needs to be enhanced to be a dynamic platform that can react to failure, resource contention, and performance degradation in the system.\u00a0 In this talk, we present and demonstrate an OpenStack enhanced dynamic network fabric that offers high availability, manageability, and performance required for carrier-grade. To react to network dynamics we provide underlay network aware PoP level rerouting. Within the PoP, we find the best resource reallocation via bandwidth-guaranteed VM placement. In addition, we use SLA verification to check if the reactions satisfy the SLAs.<\/p>",

We will show that an intelligent overlay routing and VM placement mechanism are in place to guarantee high performance and availability when workloads are relocated and the underlay network changes.\u00a0 To bookend these features, a dynamic SLA assurance engine will be shown to catch SLA violations.

With the help of a graphical model representing the different relationships between system entities, and a friendly UI, Vitrage hopes to achieve its mission of organizing, analyzing and visualizing a holistic view of the system.<br \/>In this talk, we will present and discuss the first steps of augmenting Vitrage with machine learning capabilities. Until recently, Vitrage used mostly humanly-written templates to drive automatic RCA, deduced alarms &amp; states. The next step is to start detecting those rules in the data itself, discovering connections over time from the observed history. Here we will discuss the challenge, where Vitrage is today, and what to expect in the near future in this exciting journey. <\/p>",

Default Hadoop and Spark can not leverage the high-performance<br \/>networking features (e.g., RDMA, SR-IOV) on modern clouds efficiently. These<br \/>frameworks are traditionally written with sockets and do not deliver the best<br \/>performance on modern high-performance networks. In this talk, we will provide<br \/>an in-depth overview of the architecture of Hadoop and Spark. We will examine<br \/>the challenges in re-designing networking components of these frameworks with<br \/>modern interconnects and mechanisms (such as IB, RoCE, RDMA). Using the<br \/>publicly available software packages in the High-Performance Big Data (HiBD,<br \/>http:\/\/hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu) project, we will provide case studies of the<br \/>new designs for several Hadoop\/Spark components and their associated benefits.<br \/>Through developing Heat-based complex appliances, we will present the fast<br \/>provisioning of these frameworks on OpenStack-based clouds, like NSF Chameleon.<\/p>",

Unfortunately, today majority of OpenStack APIs are associated with virtual instances instead of applications. As application developers produce software for cloud based deployment, they still cannot seamlessly tap into the flexible cloud based deployment environment because much of the benefits of a cloud based environment revolves around the infrastructure.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/>E.g., auto-scaling of a service in the cloud is a very powerful tool but it remains an infrastructure service and not an API for the application developer.

Generally speaking, the Openstack manages 200-300 nodes in the single region for the routine scenario, because of the performance limitation of some of the main centralized components, a.k.a. rabbitmq, mysql, keystone and haproxy. As the conclusion of test, we found the Opentack has been becoming more and more unstable while the numbers of&nbsp;nodes were over the threshold.&nbsp;For the sake of managing more nodes, we had some work on stratege and architecture including some optimization in code.<\/p>\r\n<p>I will talk about the following agendas in this session.<\/p>\r\n<p>1. What's the facts affect the scalability of openstack and metrics of operformance.<\/p>\r\n<p>2. How to optimize the perfomannce of message queue.<\/p>\r\n<p>3.

While containers provide high scale, low latency and a low startup time, however, no one really understands the complete impact of containers on how it changes the virtualization model for NFV and what impact it has on the networking and&nbsp;orchestration model for NFV.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Containers are well dsigned for scale out applications but for containers to work with NFV we need the ability to assign public IP addresses to containers. That is not so easy as it sounds.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span>In this presentation, we will discuss the NFV architecture with containers in detail. In particular we will discuss topics&nbsp;like Kuryr (Containers and Openstack), Container networking, Container instantiation with Openstack, Scale, Performance (Latency and Throughput) and data path acceleration for containers.<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Existing TCO models for OpenStack clouds [1,2,3] are focused heavily around cost savings\/ cost per virtual machines. They also tend to be focused heavily on a specific vendor offering. ROI models, on other hand, are pratically non-existent. This trend is not unique to just OpenStack private clouds. TCO models for AWS public cloud also tend to focus on VMs and extend to some other services. However, true ROI from adopting cloud services comes from the business agility it enables. Currently, there are no TCO\/ ROI models that quantify this.<\/p>\n<p>This talk summarizes our research at CloudDon [5] and presents TCO\/ ROI for OpenStack clouds from the perspective of representative workloads and consumption models. This also goes beyond existing metrics such as Cost Per Vm or Cost Per TB by quantifying business impact OpenStack enables.<\/p>",

Although the cross-community collaboration is usually difficult in practice, the developers working in the mentioned communities make it work seamlessly with a shared common focus on solving technical problems. In this panel, you will hear developers involved with Kolla-Kubernetes and OpenStack-Helm talking about their first-hand experiences of working with the Kubernetes\/Helm project by identifying operator&rsquo;s gaps and communicating requirements through live design sessions targeted at the development of Kolla-Kubernetes and OpenStack-Helm.

But the benefits this change in approach brings, which include continuous, agile updates and uninterrupted service upgrades, far outweigh the resources, time, and training to effectively transition from one approach to the other.

TripleO is a project aimed at exactly that: using one OpenStack cloud to deploy and manage another.<\/p>\n<p>Applications designed for the cloud often share some common properties: microservices architecture, elasticity, multi-tenancy, and scalability. Traditional data center applications also have their own set of requirements: physical storage, heterogeneous hardware, and existing management tools. These two sets of requirements often contrast with one other.<\/p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll discuss how TripleO balances these approaches and bridges the gap between these two methods. We'll discuss how the TripleO feature set meets the needs of deploying OpenStack as both a cloud and traditional<br \/>application. We'll cover how TripleO uses Heat, Ironic, and Neutron, and we\u2019ll highlight some of the recent additions to OpenStack that could be integrated into TripleO.<\/p>",

Petabytes of data, thousands of requests per second, and clusters with hundreds of nodes are just a normal Tuesday for Swift clusters. But when Swift was first released seven years ago, 4TB drives were big and 24-bay storage nodes were dense. These days, you can buy 10TB drives and put 80 of them in one server. Continent-spanning clusters are normal, and workloads with billions of objects are expected. This massive increase in scale brings new challenges for any storage system, and the Swift community has risen to the task. Come hear about improvements made in Swift to support the biggest storage hardware available today and how we&rsquo;re continually improving the system to tackle the challenges ahead.<\/span><\/p>",

There are plenty of operator level tutorials easily accessible, but developer contribution guides or tutorials are often limited. This may scare away developers that are used to such an ecosystem resulting in opportunities foregone.<\/p>\r\n<p>To tackle these problems for people starting out, we will be discussing interactive ways to explore OpenStack using the Python Debugger and testr.

Expectation is ML can be utilized to train AI systems to recognize patterns in vast amounts of real time network telemetry data, providing early recognition of developing network performance issues, before they negatively impact human experience.

With the dispatch of OpenStack's 14th release dubbed Newton, OpenStack makers affirm that it now incorporates enhanced scaling abilities. The Operations team at the OpenStack Innovation Center decided to demonstrate that OpenStack is effortlessly scalable to 500 nodes in a single region. To complete this task, we decided to work on a tool that allows them to target a set number of servers and \"partition\" them; if you have 10 physical servers, split those into 100 virtual servers, and use them as compute nodes within an OpenStack deployment. In this session we will examine the simulator tool, deep dive into its internals, and run through a demo. You will learn how you might utilize it to test the scaling of various OpenStack services and decrease the cost of creating labs and staging environments within your company.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p class=\"p1\">As the number and scope of OpenStack projects expands, project creators have a need to rapidly test that their project is interoperable with the core OpenStack services. Developers need to be able to test that their code does not break this interoperability without the hassle of extensive manual testing. Core reviewers need to ensure that new patches do not break the functionality that their project offers to the core OpenStack services. All of this can be accomplished by leveraging the Tempest project to create a specific software library called a Tempest plugin. This presentation explains exactly how a Tempest plugin fits into the OpenStack ecosystem, provides a step by step tutorial on how to create a Tempest plugin, demonstrates how to use the plugin to run tests in a local cloud, and explains how to test new code by incorporating an existing project's plugin into OpenStacks test infrastructure.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>In most cloud deployments, a mix of cloud-native (cattle) and traditional (pet) workloads exist. Traditional, non-cloud workloads require infrastructure support to manage availability. Openstack Masakari project recovers pet workloads from hardware\u00a0failures by automatically re-locating VMs to healthy nodes. It\u00a0relies on infrastructure monitoring to detect failures e.g. pacemaker. Although workloads from a failed node are recovered, distributed consensus cluster needs reconfiguration. Cloud admin is expected to reconfigure node monitoring software and re-establish the consensus. Platform9 implemented a zero touch node monitoring solution with consul. This solution integrates with Masakari API to provides a completely automated HA for Openstack. In this talk, we present a deep dive on Masakari and automated cluster management for HA clusters.<\/p>",

It will compare capabilities of familiar DevOps tools, such as Ansible, Juju\/MaaS, Nagios\/Icinga, Zabbix, ELK, Ganglia, Grafana, etc. The DevOps landscape is extensive and it can be confusing to understand the pros and cons of a particular stack of applications to complement Cloud operation needs.

      "description": "<p>While cloud allows users to provision resources on-demand and gives an illusion of unlimited capacity, in reality the underlying resources are limited and require resource sharing which could cause inefficient cloud operation. This is especially important for NFV clouds, where service degradation may occur if additional resources are not available adjacent to the resources for a network service that may experience expected or unexpected spike in traffic.<br \/><br \/>OPNFV Promise project was initiated to solve this problem by introducing resource reservation for future usage. Since OpenStack is considered to be the defacto VIM for NFV, OPNFV Promise team is collaborating with OpenStack Blazar project and Product Working Group to address this issue.<br \/><br \/><br \/>This session will aim to provide an overview of how Promise and Blazar address the following<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Accept future resource usage requests<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Provide guaranteed access to reserved resources<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Manage resource usage conflicts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",

There is a large infrastructure pool with 600+ types of applications running on 6000+ hosts to provide service for 1.1 billion people in China. By the end of 2016, we had successfully deployed OpenStack-based cloud in 31 datacenters from 26 provinces .The presentation will give the case study of OpenStack practice in SGCC in the past 2 years to transform the distributed legacy architecture to an unified cloud. We will share our BKMs to solve challenges to deliver OpenStack in such a large organization. There are also challges in security-domain compliance, legacy virtualization environment integration and the upcoming demands on operation automation. This presentation will go through them and give the solution which we had done in SGCC Cloud Resource Management Platform based on OpenStack.<\/p>",

Unified networking simplifies deployment, configuration and provides single pane of glass into management and troubleshooting.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this session we will dive into Kuryr Kubernetes and demo Pods running on Nova instances consuming VM workloads via OpenStack Neutron.<\/p>",

However, in a large scale system, which requires updating, adding or deleting up to thousands of firewall rules, it takes a long time to execute thousands of conntrack commands to delete conntrack entries. In a performance test, conntrack costs up to 458.40 seconds to apply 10.000 firewall rules [3]. That puts updating firewall \u2013 which directly related to system security into a significant threat.<\/p>\n<p>We would like to introduce a new method to improve above problem: Using Netlink solution [4]. This patch saves time by developing a Netlink library to avoid running thousands of conntrack commands (which need to open a Python subprocess for each) from iptables_fwaas driver. The performance test [3] shows that our solution costs only 5.41 seconds (up to 98% time saving) to apply 10.000 firewall rules.<\/p>\n<p>Our solution's been applied to FWaaS v1 in Ocata cycle, and it is beeing applied to FWaaS v2 and Neutron.<\/p>\n<p><span>(Demo included)<\/span><\/p>",

Such changes are difficult to drive and nurture in organization which promotes open source as well as closed source.&nbsp;This paper talks about key motivators for organization to go for Open Source. Further once decided, how to create and promote such culture in organization.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In NEC Technologies India we started journey in Openstack in 2012 in small way. Gradually we nurtured Openstack community by providing enablers at organization level. As a result, since last 4 years, many members started contributing in Openstack community at various levels and so far we contributed more than 300,000 LoC across 6-7 openstack release and many reviews in openstack community from India center. This paper will talk about experiences in driving such change in culture of organization and its impact in community. We will also talk about challeges faced by us in recruiting, training and retaining Openstack team.<\/p>",

The pace of upstream development of OpenStack mandates the need for a tool that is highly configurable and quickly deployable. This talk is on Syntribos, which is an automated API security testing tool created and supported by the OpenStack Security Project. Syntribos aims to automatically detect common security defects such as SQL injection, XXE injection, authentication &amp; authorization defects, buffer overflow etc. and possible new defects by automated fuzzing. With release of the latest version, the tool has been augmented with a set of features focussing on new tests, ease of automation, minimal configuration efforts and usability. During the talk, we would like to discuss about API security in the RESTful world, emphasize on the reasons for the existence of a tool like Syntribos, its implementation and on automated scans against OpenStack APIs.<\/span><\/p>",

Although NFV workload requests reach operator as a batch, NOVA scheduler only works on a first come first serve basis. This generally results in sub-optimal placement and stranding resource usage. In this talk, we will present a new offline placement algorithm. The tool dynamically collects resource usage of the cloud and takes the batch workload requests as inputs. All the special requests of each VNF, such as affinity, anit-affinity, NUMA, CPU, SR-IOV, memory and so on, will be used as constrains. Then the tool generate an optimized placement plan for cloud operators using Genetic Algorithm. In the end of presentation, we also compare the new algorithm with different heuristic approaches.<\/p>",

Although Swift has become extremely popular recently, its proxy server based design limits the overall throughput and scalability of the cluster. Swift is based on the traditional TCP\/IP sockets-based communication which has known performance issues such as context-switch and buffer copies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Modern high-performance interconnects such as InfiniBand and RoCE offer advanced features such as RDMA and provide high bandwidth and low latency communication.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>In this talk, we will present two new designs to improve the performance and scalability of Swift. We propose changes to the Swift architecture and high-performance implementations of network communication and I\/O modules based on RDMA to provide the fastest possible object transfer. Besides, we use efficient hashing algorithms to accelerate object verification in Swift.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Evaluations reveal up to 2x and 7.3x performance improvement with our two proposed designs.<\/span><\/p>",

For ex, how often have you (developer, ops) asked one or more of the following questions?<\/p>\r\n<p>1. What does it take to create &amp; manage a new micro-service? (Governance) <br \/>2. How do we identify micro-services canonically across infrastructure\/platform services? (Identity) <br \/>3. How do we allocate resources for micro-services? (Resource provisioning) <br \/>4. What does it take to operate a micro-service? (Deploy Orchestration, Monitoring) <br \/>5. How do we measure resource utilization and cost of operating a micro-service?<\/p>\r\n<p>I will share how we addressed these problems at companies like Twitter &amp; Pinterest.

For example, When there is a proliferation of micro-services in an organization, it becomes difficult to track who owns what services and its relevant metadata. Once of the first things to solve is build a service directory.<br \/>3. How to enable teams to move faster when building &amp; launching services? For example, It doesn't make sense for every developer to provision &amp; manage public\/private cloud resources by themselves. Abstracting resource provisioning enables governance &amp; clear accountability on who owns what leading to better cost &amp; utilization efficiency.<br \/>4. How to incentivize teams to utilize resources effectively &amp; make cost-conscious design decisions? Ex, Detailed Metering &amp; Chargeback reporting.<br \/>5.

The number of applications we run is growing daily as we migrate all our apps onto OpenStack, with the target end state of 1300 KVM compute nodes, split over 2 datacenters, which will make up 100,000 cores and 2.08 petabytpes of storage. We&nbsp;run a continuous delivery self-service model against our OpenStack API's, where we do over 1000 deployments a day to test and production environments using Ansible -- this deployment figure is growing each day. Running OpenStack at such a scale has challenges which need to be addressed as the platform is scaled out.

The VMs will be attached to hostdev devices which will increase the throughput for the NFV applications and help get as close to wire-line speed as possible for virtual machines. This implementation provides better performance, PMD accesses the RX and TX descriptors directly without any interrupts. With this set of features operator could achieve a boost to the networking performance and can leverage the Layer 2 switch on NIC for virtual machine traffic. The operator can configure advanced features for the VFs on supported NICs like VLAN filtering, mac spoofing, multicast mode, QinQ, insert tag, strip tag etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>This proposed solution will allow operators to configure VFs at a more granular level with all the features available on cards and provide more flexibility to the NFV users.<\/p>",

While useful (and<br \/>used by some of the largest clouds), this initial implementation had<br \/>many drawbacks, missing features, lack of testing and brought a lot of<br \/>complexity and duplicated code paths.<\/p>\r\n<p>Recently the Nova project has been working on \"cells version 2\", a<br \/>different approach to solve the same problem, integrated into the main<br \/>code from the beginning, and simpler to understand and deploy. Unlike<br \/>version 1, everyone is running version 2 code all the time, even if<br \/>they have not sharded their deployment. Changes in Ocata bring us<br \/>closer to being able to use the new implementation for production<br \/>deployments, and they introduce a number of changes that every<br \/>operator needs to understand.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

It is therefore easy to fall in the trap of considering that OpenStack, as an infrastructure provider, is not relevant in a containers world. However, container technologies still require someone to provide flexible infrastructure for that abstraction layer to live on.<br \/><br \/>OpenStack provides programmable infrastructure (bare metal, VMs, container orchestration engines, networking or storage services) that can then be used by application developers. In this talk, we'll explore how complementary Openstack is to container technologies like Docker or Kubernetes, and how they answer orthogonal questions in a harmonious way. We'll expose what key issue (and which stakeholders) each solution actually answers to, then dive into examples of where that complementarity already shows: Kuryr, hyper.sh, OpenStack itself using Kubernetes for its own deployment...<\/p>",

The case Cyborg targets is vital for HPC cloud implementation which usually requires a lot of such devices\/accelerators, especially FPGA and GPU cards. Public and NFV cloud implementation also has similar requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will first introduce the background story of Cyborg project, and then demonstrate the current status (architecture, code development,..) of the project, and finally give an example of how Cyborg working with Nova and other OpenStack component could help HPC cloud implementation.",

There are several technical capabilities and business factors coming together to make this approach very compelling from both an application development and deployment cost perspective. By breaking down monolithic applications into smaller services, you can develop, manage, and scale each service independently. FaaS takes this a step further by breaking things down even smaller.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">So, what is Serverless\/FaaS?

      "description": "<p>The IBM Systems Cloud Solutions Group helps many customers realize their own private OpenStack Cloud infrastructure. Recently we considered how to best handle this task using exclusively open source solutions. For provisioning we settled on OpenStack-Ansible. We have used it heavily and became familiar with its strengths and how to leverage the framework to provide additional value to the end user. We have added our own playbooks to this solution with open DevOps tools to fulfill Operational Management aspects, such as Monitoring, Log Collection &amp; Analysis, Performance, Scalability, Discovery and Inventory Management. In this session, we share our findings. We show our approach to integrate a stack of Ops tools with OSA for automated deployment and configuration. We also discuss how we are enhancing our solution to adjust the Ops configuration elastically to achieve coverage after our Cluster scales or is reconfigured. We expect that our experience and ideas will help other endeavors.<\/p>",

As an multi-tenant and secure Kubernetes distribution powered by OpenStack core components, h8s creates hypervisor-based containers (HyperContainer) directly on physical servers instead of wrapping containers inside VMs. Comparing to OS containers, kernel features of this HyperContainer is completely isolated from \"noisy neighbors\" but still have all benefits of cloud native deployment (e.g. Docker image, container api, sub-seconds startup time). VNFs in this case will be deployed in highly secured sandboxes, while still with agility and scalibility. This is the key challenge of containerizing NFV. This talk will compare service agility, performance, isolation, portability and scalability of VNFs deployed by VM, container, and hypervisor-container stack. And demonstrate how h8s containerize NFV with both container level efficiency and VM level security.<\/p>",

This has been slowing down both operations and customer support, often leaving team members frustrated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>With a bit of search and lots of community help from other OpenStack operators, we put in place the new system.

It is one thing to learn something for yourself; it is quite another to teach it to someone else. So it is with OpenStack. You&rsquo;ve been building skills and connections along your OpenStack journey. Why not progress from OpenStack ninja to sensei? OpenStack mentoring is relatively new (it started just before the Austin Summit), and provides a great way to build the OpenStack community, help newcomers on their journey, and build leaders in the process. The OpenStack mentoring program is sponsored by Women of OpenStack.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Come join us for a panel discussion on the benefits of OpenStack mentoring featuring the program coordinator and past and present mentor\/mentee pairs.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;<\/p>",

Current implementation status in OpenStack is variable between projects and almost projects have not fully implemented rolling upgrade. One among Kolla's deliverables is OpenStack container-based deployment tool, thus adding zero-downtime upgrade support in Kolla is reasonable. Our approach is to implement in Kolla natively without needing support from individual OpenStack service. We propose 2 solutions for this problem. First approach achieve real \"zero-downtime\" from user PoV if upgrade time is short enough, but fail if upgrade time is too long, and it consumes much memory if system is under heavy load during upgrading. Second approach requires more resources than the first one and user will see a short downtime but does not suffer timeout problem. So we can combine two solutions to get advantages from each. The spec and demo for the 1st solution has been proposed and in review queue of Kolla community.<\/p>",

This problem is known as the \"noisy neighbor problem\". We present a strategy for automatic noisy neighbor detection and mitigation in the form of VM migration or deletion. Our algorithm uses metrics forwarded to Ceilometer by the Cache Monitoring Technology and Memory Bandwidth Monitoring to determine if a specific VM is a noisy neighbor. We implemented the algorithm as a strategy in OpenStack Watcher which does continuous optimization for multi-tenant OpenStack-based clouds and will demo the strategy at the summit during the session.<\/span><\/p>",

On another hand, you can get a better experience of running OpenStack on top of Kubernetes and take advantage of scaling OpenStack services and performing seamless rolling upgrades.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this workshop you going to learn how to deploy and upgrade&nbsp;<span>OpenStack<\/span> on top of Kubernetes for development needs and testing, using official&nbsp;Kubernetes&nbsp;packaging tool - Helm.<\/p>\r\n<p>Attendees simply need to come in (with their laptop). Workshop speaker\/organizer will provide instructions and will be available to answer any questions.<\/p>",

For example, during the daytime, large amount of users gather in the CBD[2] area and the workload of network traffic system is high. When they get off work, the user numbers declines rapidly and so does the network traffic workload. The problem is how to fulfill user network service requirements with minimal energy consumption given the changing network traffic workloads.<\/span><br \/>As a real case from ZTE corporation, this problem is addressed by the following way. When the workload is low, we consolidate\u00a0VMs (virtual machines)\u00a0to several hosts\u00a0by live migration, and\u00a0power off the hosts without VMs to reduce power consumption.\u00a0Correspondingly,\u00a0when\u00a0the workload boosts, we power on those hosts again and lively migrate the VMs back to them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>We will present the above algorithms and implement them as\u00a0a strategy\u00a0in Watcher.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Deploying OpenStack in a large scale environment, we can regard Message Queue(MQ) as a bottleneck.<br \/>To solve this, OpenStack operators typically tune MQ or separate the MQ into multi clusters. However, operators suffer from managing and tuning multiple MQ clusters and investigating which OpenStack projects have heavy workloads for the clusters.<\/p>\r\n<p>NTT Communications is planning to expand its cloud environment to 1000+ nodes per region. Therefore the better way to improve performance on MQ becomes one of the essential considerations.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this session, we will first provide our findings from the operators' side that, a single RabbitMQ cluster can improve its performance while keeping High-Availability by scale-out without any tuning. We also show the bottleneck issues in Nova conductor queue found in the survey.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then based on the operator's feedbacks, the developers made efforts against the issues and eventually succeeded to relieve the bottleneck in Nova with separated conductor message bus.<\/p>",

Some might overcome complexity in operations, discovery and monitoring of their cloud by manual processes and\/or complex batch operations. I'm offering a journey of troubleshooting and discovery cycles in a typical Cloud that we run today, suggest elegant ways to overcome overheads.

      "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Last year Veritas engineers, in conjunction with Target engineers, worked to extend the multi cloud deployment tool Spinnaker to support deployments into OpenStack. Both teams use OpenStack for internal development. Our goal was to contribute\u00a0a Spinnaker provider for OpenStack to leverage a hybrid cloud environment in our continuous delivery pipelines. We have completed this Spinnaker provider and have turned it over to other OpenStack users to test out. Along the way we encountered many challenges working within the OpenStack environment - such as documentation, feature deprecation and support of replacement features, and the configuration of single node OpenStack environments. We would like to share these challenges with the community so that others looking to add support for OpenStack in their tools can learn from our experience.\u00a0We look forward to sharing our story and opening up the opportunity to collaborate further.<\/p>",

The most challenge is Ironic and neutron network integration:<br \/> 1. NOT support vxlan &amp; port group.<br \/> 3. We evaluate network-generic-switch driver, so far only support parts of the switch vendors with a limitation of the functionality.<br \/> 4. Switching from provision network to tenant network is not easy.<br \/> In order to meet the core networking requirement, we evaluate SDN solutions with several major SDN vendors, including HUAWEI, ZTE, H3C and Nuage Network. Thanks to our deep cooperation, from Solution Selection to Proof of Concept and finally to Final Acceptance Test, we finally integrated Ironic with SDN solution, thus enables network automation and provisioning. Besides, we successfully used dynamic port group and flexible security group to enable high availability and high security features.<\/p>",

We review OpenStack open source policy in general and its implementation for specific projects. We discuss the reasons for opening the source code, and address the community discussions pertinent to the decision process.<\/p>\r\n<p>The presentation includes the caveats and obstacles for such a move. Some of them are common to all new drivers, and some are unique for transition from a closed to open source. Step by step we overcome the obstacles (legal, business, standards, CI) and change of work flows. We conclude with a discussion of the benefits of being part of the community and adhering to its standards. Together we unlock the door to an open new world.<\/p>",

In openstack Tacker takes the responsibility of building a Generic VNF Manager (VNFM) and a NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) to deploy and operate Network Services and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on the infrastructure platform. For the VNFs which can work as a loadbalancer or a firewall, Tacker needs to consider the availability of each VNF to ensure they are not overloaded or out of work. To prevent VNFs from being overloaded or down, Tacker need to make VNFs HA and auto-scaling. So in fact the VNFs of certain function should not be a single node, but a cluster.<\/p>\r\n<p>That comes out a problem of cluster managing.

However, a cloud-first strategy and a desire to consume infrastructure as a service has led to many workloads being deployed on clouds that may not be the ideal choice. With many facets to the financial costs of hosting workloads including physical compute\/networking\/storage resources and human expertise, we have found that many customers are seeing significant savings when they migrate their long running or always on workloads running in public clouds back on-premises.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;\">This session focuses on how an OpenStack private cloud has distinct cost advantages over an AWS given certain workload requirements.&nbsp; More specifically, we&rsquo;ll highlight a customer use case leveraging Rackspace Private Cloud powered by Red Hat in the data center of their choosing to host their heavy utilization and high network bandwidth workloads with significant cost savings compared to AWS.<\/span><\/p>",

Transitioning from a package based deployment of the Icehouse release, to a stream lined containerization of all the Liberty control plane components, this was the only natural progression to tackle such a complex upgrade.While containerization gave a huge over haul to the control plane operations, there was an urgent need to offer higher availability at the network layer. Seeing the need to spread the failure domain at the physical network layer, we moved to a horizontally scalable topology using VXLAN on the TOR switches.Between the upgrade of OpenStack components and network changes, the upgrade methodology exercised helped us maintain an average downtime of 15 mins across thousands of instances. This talk covers our upgrade methodology, architecture changes and lessons learned as Verisign plays amongst the clouds.<\/p>",

SR-IOV can<br \/>deliver near-native performance but lacks locality-aware communication support.<br \/>This talk presents an efficient approach to building HPC clouds based on MVAPICH2<br \/>over OpenStack with SR-IOV. We discuss high-performance designs of the virtual<br \/>machine and container aware MVAPICH2 library over OpenStack-based HPC Clouds<br \/>with SR-IOV. The talk will also present a high-performance virtual machine<br \/>migration framework for MPI applications on SR-IOV enabled InfiniBand clouds.<br \/>A comprehensive performance evaluation with micro-benchmarks and HPC<br \/>applications on NSF-supported Chameleon Cloud, which is developed on OpenStack,<br \/>shows that our design can deliver near the bare-metal performance. The MVAPICH2<br \/>over OpenStack software package presented in this talk is publicly available<br \/>from http:\/\/mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu.<\/p>",

This has been shown to significantly increase developer and team productivity by decoupling dependencies between different parts of a team.<\/p>\r\n<p>However, most legacy code consists of a large monolithic code base, not microservices applications. And, the lesson of second system syndrome is that many attempted code rewrites will end in failure, as the first system will evolve faster than the replacement system can be developed to displace it. A cloud native architecture that is only useful for new greenfield deployments is not very useful at all.<\/p>",

In doing so, they demonstrated that the cloud native architecture is suitable across most categories of computing, including both greenfield and brownfield development.<\/p>",

It has to deal with different share- and stakeholders as well as with different funding agencies to reflect their needs and interests.

      "description": "Are enterprise companies adopting open source? Behind open source, there is a strong culture, and sometimes in some organizations debates on whether or not to use it, or contribute to it, can rise. Open source strikes a challenge for people to approach things in an innovative way, look for solutions that are outside the traditional box, and doing so in a collaborative environment where transparency is the most significant asset. \r\n\r\nIf you have questions about open source or OpenStack private cloud adoption within your organization, then this discussion will help with some of those understandings. Often times, enterprises struggle with the idea of using open source and OpenStack without sacrificing intellectual property. Often times, cultural and organizational changes are needed to be able to play in the open source world.",

I moved to Eindhoven (The Netherlands) to do postgrad research on plasma physics; I have moved to Cologne (Germany) with my family some years ago.<br \/><br \/>I have starting working on Linux in the mid 90s and have a number of kernel patches contributed successfully between 1996 and 2013 as well as small contributions to other open source projects, including glibc and gcc. I was working as kernel engineer for SUSE Linux AG since 1999 and I have had the honor to build up and lead a great team of people with the SUSE Labs department there from 2003 on. I served in a number of management roles (head architect, VP engineering (acting), business development, ...) in SUSE. Working with and inside the community there was very inspiring -- I spent a lot of time explaining the philosophy, the development model and the business model to potential customers, analysts or the press. I also had the pleasure to serve on the program comittees of some open source events, most notably many years for Linux-Kongress and LCE 2011.<\/p>\r\n<p>After the departure from SUSE in 2011, I was looking for the next great transformative technology in IT and found OpenStack.<\/p>\r\n<p>I joined the BU Cloud Services in Deutsche Telekom's P&amp;I&nbsp; -- there I headed the engineering unit that developed the Consumer Cloud Storage platform (DLS\/Mediencenter) and the OpenStack based hosting infrastructure for hosting the software partners' apps in DT's TelekomCloud BusinessMarketplace. DT became a user, contributor and vocal supporter of OpenStack and the usage of OpenStack has since expanded into many areas -- last not least the large network transformation (terastream) project that will power the next generation network in DT.<br \/><br \/>I was supporting Huawei's Enterprise IT R&amp;D department (as freelancer) to build a great cloud engineering team in Europe and to enhance the capabilities of Huawei's OpenStack based FusionSphere solutions before I joined T-Systems to build and launch a major OpenStack based public cloud out of Europe with Open Telekom Cloud. OTC was launched in March 2016 focused initially on European customers, both targeting the large global enterprises and public sector that is the traditional customer base of T-Systems as well as smaller companies (typically served by DT country organizations). OTC focuses on data security and privacy, openness, ease of use and is price competitive to the market leaders. OTC has seen numerous improvements and enhancements (such as e.g. DNS service and a container service) since the launch and&nbsp; I am building up a team of engineers and architects to work on further development of OpenStack and Open Telekom Cloud. I also supported Deutsche Telekom (and its IT arm T-Systems) to participate in a number of local events as well as becoming headline sponsor for the Barcelona OpenStack summit and getting gold membership in the Foundation.<br \/><br \/><\/p>",

I saw an opportunity to help with OpenStack upstream development, and struggled at first. I first started the effort by wrestling Devstack, then proceeded to crawl around the API WSGI layer with pdb to teach myself OpenStack. I am currently helping with the effort to upstream Role-Based Access Control testing in a plugin to Tempest called Patrole.<\/p>\r\n<p>I believe the OpenStack contributor community can garner a very giant pool of potential contributors from developers traditionally with a web development background, and am working currently to get more people involved.<\/p>",
