It is not uncommon to hear occasional \u201cgasps\u201d of disbelief from the participants. The workshop participants will thus experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations.<\/p>\n<p>Target audience: Technical Women who regularly attend technical meetings working groups and would like to develop and \u201ccommand their presence\u201d in high pressure meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Panelists: Jessica Murillo, Steve Gordon,\u00a0Ruchi Bhargava\u00a0<\/p>",

We plan to divide the session between career and technical mentoring. Mentees will be organized into small groups and each group will have several 15 minute mentoring sessions. In your small group, you'll get to know a bit about a mentor and have an opportunity to ask them a question or two about how you can grow your career, get involved in the community, and make the most of the summit. Then, at the end of 15 minutes, a new mentor will cycle to your group and the process will repeat.<\/p>\n<p>If you're already a part of the OpenStack community, please consider signing up as a mentor. It's a wonderful way to meet new people, and pass on a bit of your knowledge about our community. Mentors will need to show up slightly earlier (by 7:15am, but breakfast is provided!). We will have a preparation call for mentors before the summit to go over what you should expect from the event.<\/p>\n<p>More information about the Mentoring Program, sponsored by the Women of OpenStack, is available here. <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Mentors\">https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Mentors<\/a><\/p>",

There will be no formal presentations, and a moderate level of knowledge around running OpenStack is assumed.

This may be because operators themselves must ensure encryption of data at rest to satisfy regulatory and\/or customer requirements, or because clients do not wish to manage encryption keys.<\/p>\r\n<p>With this new feature Swift is able to encrypt objects as they are received through a Swift proxy. This has advantages over other server-side encryption approaches: encrypting content once in the proxy incurs lower CPU overhead than having each replica encrypted on object servers using existing block encryption tools such as dm-crypt; encrypting in Swift itself avoids the cost of upgrading hardware to self-encrypting disks.<\/p>",

This existing solution has proven itself in production: it enables us to support such needs as live migrating the VMs on 19,000 hosts, or deploying the next release of OpenStack, with minimal manual remediation. We are able to carry out complex, multistage remediations based on Ansible.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14.666666666666666px; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">Our approach is unique and operator-focused, with Craton building on a proven methodology for systematically managing a fleet of hosts\/devices at scale. One example is audit: operators need to know what&rsquo;s different about their environment - data that&rsquo;s not necessarily captured by asset management; nor is it reported on by monitoring\/metrics. Instead, we allow operators to craft their own audits, get results, and use that for their remediations. Consider this scenario: what should have been the same server builds had slightly different available memory to the OS; which in turn impacted migrations.<\/span><\/p>",

But this also means that this talk will be helpful if you\u2019re operating a small private cloud, and you want to offer similar SLAs - perhaps the biggest difference is how often problems happen in the underlying fleet.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, we will walk through some typical automation scenarios, such as applying an OpenStack Ansible security audit and remediation; Nova compute restarts; live migrations; storage capacity reallocations and the like. We will look at the opportunities in integrating with tooling like Walmart\u2019s OneOps.<\/p>\n<p>We also will talk about not only the strengths of Rackspace\u2019s current solution, but also its weaknesses, such as being tightly coupled to Rackspace\u2019s asset management system; and what prompted us to develop Craton as the next generation platform for fleet management.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\"><font size=\"3\">With test driven development, continuous integration\/continuous deployment and devops practices now the norm, most organizations understand the importance of testing their applications. But what about the cloud those applications are going to live on? Too many companies miss this critical step, leading to gaps in their operations, which can lead to production issues, API outages, inability to upgrade, and general instability of the cloud. It all begs the question: \u201cDo you even test? During this session, attendees will learn how Rackspace leverages Red Hat\u2019s Distributed Continuous Integration (DCI) to build a better OpenStack experience for their customers while reducing the time required to not only roll out the latest version of OpenStack to new customers, but also begin upgrading customers within weeks of announcement. In addition to this, the automated testing in DCI raises bugs directly with Red Hat QAs team to shorten the feedback cycle and improve the final product.<\/font><\/font><\/font><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

With the added complexity of now being also responsible for what\u2019s going on under the hood in the cloud platform, it\u2019s getting even more important to have a holistic, clear picture of the health of your application, the underlying infrastructure, as well as the end-user experience. We know that bad application performance is directly related to declining revenue. Can you tell the difference between bad performance of an application and bad performance of a cloud platform, like OpenStack? Both now and in the future application monitoring is going to be a key element. Providing good end user experience will be a deciding factor if your business is successful or not, and the performance of the underlying cloud platform provides a significant contribution. To that end, you need to have monitoring in place that provides insights into OpenStack\u2019s internals and can correlate events from the control plane with events of your applications.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Reliable Openstack deployment should be as close to 100% availability as possible and always up to date with the latest release. To achieve this, during an upgrade services should be stopped and replaced with new one with no API downtime. In projects like keystone, glance or neutron this means keeping compatibility of DB schema between releases. The complexity of maintaining this compatibility, while keeping performance and security on a high level, is a hot topic in the community. Current approach in projects like nova or cinder requires keeping the data compatibility for 2 or 3 releases. In this presentation we want to show solutions, how to reduce the data migration time period to one release cycle. This would reduce the code complexity and performance overhead in database layer.<\/p>",

There are thousands of variables and dozens of services in multiple possible topologies. As Operators we are the first line of defense when issues start to creep out in production. In this session we will discuss the mechanisms available to alert Operators when a problem occurs or when metrics\/trends signal that the environment is not in optimal condition anymore. We will discuss how data can be collected in different forms - logs, events, checks, etc. - and what are the most popular and effective tools being used by our community. In addition we will discuss what are the advantages\/disadvantages of these open tools when we compare existing OpenStack projects such as Ceilometer\/Aodh\/Gnocci & Monasca. In addition we will identify what content (plugins, filters, visualizations, etc.) associated to these tools is already available and shared in open source and what are best options for reuse & associated best practices. Participants are expected to share their latest developments in this important Operational area.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\">Some popular tools we would like to discuss are:<\/span><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet1\"><li><span class=\"author-a-0kz90zcz69z7bz76zz73zmz74zg3jz68zz78z\">ELK<\/span><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\"> (ElasticSearch, Logstash & Kibana)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet1\"><li><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\">Nagios, Icinga, Sensu, Zabbix, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet1\"><li><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\">Graphite\/Collectd, Influx\/Telegraf, Ganglia, Grafana, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div>\n<ul class=\"list-bullet1\"><li><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\">Intersection with existing OpenStack projects<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>\n<div><span class=\"author-a-6nxalbpz70zz122z1vz87z7z80zrd\">Lastly, we will try to make sense of the vast proliferation of monitoring tools and what are their pros and cons for different usage scenarios.<\/span><\/div>\n<div>\u00a0<\/div>",

However the roles and responsibilities of Neutron end here, to deliver broader networking capabilities and take programmatic control of the underlying network an SDN controller is of value. OpenDaylight is a popular SDN controller, it provides multiple southbound APIs and a model driven abstraction layer allowing systematic programmability of multi-vendor devices.<br \/><br \/>Current efforts to integrate OpenDaylight into an OpenStack environment have focused on simply delivering the same functionality as Neutron. In this presentation we will demonstrate how OpenDaylight can be used to configure underlay network elements such as a firewall and expose this ability as a service for OpenStack tenants to take advantage of, essentially allowing physical FWaaS.<\/p>",

To accomplish this NTT West is using an application within OpenDaylight that exposes a model driven REST API that can provision network elements that traditionally only support CLI as a configuration method. <br \/>Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) is one example where the SDN Controller is able to manage the firewall vendor specific configuration and at the same time provide an abstraction layer exposed to OpenStack users, admins and services.<br \/>This presentation will demonstrate how a FWaaS can be integrated in OpenStack including a Horizon dashboard which allows non-technical (or low-tech) operational staff to handle majority devices configuration tasks without knowledge of the device. The solution provides an automated provisioning workflow for the specific service and operational processes of each type of device.<\/p>",

However the roles and responsibilities of Neutron end here, to deliver broader networking capabilities and take programmatic control of the underlying network an SDN controller is of value. OpenDaylight is a popular SDN controller, it provides multiple southbound APIs and a model driven abstraction layer allowing systematic programmability of multi-vendor devices.<br><br>Current efforts to integrate OpenDaylight into an OpenStack environment have focused on simply delivering the same functionality as Neutron. In this presentation we will demonstrate how OpenDaylight can be used to configure underlay network elements such as a firewall and expose this ability as a service for OpenStack tenants to take advantage of, essentially allowing physical FWaaS.<\/p>",

JAPAN web services require 6x network performance per server compared with traditional server farm as a result of VM aggregation and higher density. Additionally, huge and\/or burst network traffic (5~10x than ordinary) we have often received from internet. More internal backend traffic (DNS, RDB, MQ, etc.) happend accordingly. In such situations, we faced a network performance issue in our cloud.<\/p>\n<p>To overcome this, we have adopted Open vSwitch with DPDK as a software L2 switch on HyperVisor instead of LinuxBridge, built new mitaka cluster (serving 8000+ VM scale) on OCP (Open Compute Project) servers, and started operation phase now.<\/span><br \/><span>As we found many problems through our activities from OvS\/DPDK PoC phase to operation phase, we will present about combination limitation related OvS\/DPDK\/NIC driver, network architecture\/performance, L7 SLA, operation perspective, and future works.<\/p>",

We'll cover how we deployed Neutron and\u00a0how we first enabled it in new cells, and later migrated existing cells\u00a0once we were confident with the setup and sure it would scale. Finally\u00a0we'll cover the new features we're looking into or have already enabled,\u00a0such as Floating IPs, LBaaS and others.<\/p>",

We demonstrate Castellan&rsquo;s seamless interoperability with Barbican. In the future, Castellan could interface directly with appliances, i.e. those that support the Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) standard. KMIP is an OASIS standard for key management that is already widely used within industry. By adopting Castellan as a common key management interface, developers are freed from many difficult aspects of implementing key management within OpenStack services and operators are free to choose among Castellan&rsquo;s supported backends for the actual storage of keys.<\/p>",

These virtual switches can implement the behavior required by an existing standard (for example Open vSwitch implements OpenFlow compliant switching), or implement the semantics directly expressed using a program (potentially written in a domain specific language like P4). A hybrid approach is also possible, whereby portions of the behavior conform to a standard, and other portions are implemented in modules expressed in P4 or C. This presentation compares these approaches, considering aspects like the expressiveness and performance of the resulting datapath as well how these datapath variants can be integrated into OpenStack. It furthermore considers the additional implications of accelerating the datapaths using SmartNICs, again considering the implications for OpenStack.<\/p>",

It's makes easy to have distributed, self-healing and autoscaling containers clusters.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>However operators can have a hard time setting up a Kubernetes cluster. Quite some efforts have to be put in place even for the creation of a simple cluster.\u00a0Things get even more challenging when security, flexibility and scalability have to be taken into account. And what about making everything automated to satisfy the requests of all the tenants?\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Now all developers and operators can run away from this complexity by using the Kubernetes offerings inside of the OpenStack clouds.<\/p>\n<p>This talk will show how OpenStack can act as the perfect platform to run Kuberenetes clusters by using the Magnum project. OpenStack Magnum component simplifies the required integration with Kubernetes, and allows for cloud users who can already launch OpenStack resources to also create application containers to run their applications.<\/p>",

Not specific to the Newton release but the speed of development (features) and technical debt, specifically around having a huge repo with a ton of proposed changes but a relatively small active core team, always comes up. At various times different people have proposed different ideas on how to fix the code review latency issue. Ideas include simply scaling the core reviewer team (not having such a high bar to entry), decomposing the repo (breaking out the virt drivers), and subsystem maintainers (people with +2 in certain areas or features of code, but not +2 on the entire repo). This session is really meant to be a discussion between PTLs and core reviewers on various projects to see what ideas teams have tried and what has worked and what has not worked. For example, Neutron did the stadium to mixed results - but unless you are an active developer on Neutron you maybe do not know the details, so what happened?<br \/><br \/><br \/>References: <a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/nova-newton-retrospective\">Nova Newton retrospective etherpad<\/a><br \/><br \/><br \/>Session Leader(s): Matt Riedemann (mriedem), Steve Martinelli (stevemar), Doug Hellmann (dhellmann)<\/p>",

We will then spend more time describing the migration process we designed, our choices about the method and how we made it scale to PB of data and billions of objects. We will also talk about the traps we fell into.<br \/> This talk will also be the occasion to give a feedback on EC at scale, what you should and should not do when deploying EC in your clusters. Finally, we will see that with few improvements, this method can be reused for other needs.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Today there are lots of concerns regarding OpenStack (OS)\u00a0Fault Management & Resiliency. Some\u00a0due the complexity of a\u00a0distributed architecture\u00a0and most importantly is due to multiple contributors worldwide. Therefore, there are different design & development styles that are incorporated in OS where there is no uniform approach in handling issues.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of Fault Genes is to bring in the experiences from everyone in the community. Apply our methodology to enable all users (developers & operators) to be on the same page regarding OS fault management. Provide a consistent & uniform approach in handling\u00a0various faults & become the single source for understanding OS fault behavior.<\/p>\n<p>This requires strong understanding of OS & resiliency concepts to make the vision of Fault Genes working group a reality. This session will present early findings from a review of OS bugs filed in Launchpad, output from working group anlysis, and shine a light on potential areas of focus for the community.<\/p>",

Let&rsquo;s take a look on your options when it comes to monitoring your cloud platform and talk about what it takes to stay on top of highly dynamic infrastructure and a large number of constantly changing applications in order to provide end user experience that keeps you in business. Can you tell the difference between bad performance of an application and bad performance of a cloud platform? Both now and in the future application monitoring is going to be a key element. Providing good end user experience will be a deciding factor if your business is successful or not, and the performance of the underlying cloud platform provides a significant contribution.<\/p>",

This is something that can often be overlooked. It is easy to think of upstream development only in terms of features added or lines of code. But it's more than that. It's a chance to grow and gain experience by collaborating with subject matter experts from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>We will describe how you will learn from the technology, development and test methodologies OpenStack uses. How OpenStack development tooling \"automates all the things\". How strong review processes lead not just to better code, but better coders. How to collaborate and reach consensus with developers distributed across geographies -- with a healthy culture of respect.<\/p>",

A very bright real life example is the fact that some Cinder features like replication or consistency groups are possible only with a limited set of volume drivers. How can API user check if volumes created from some volume type can be replicated? Similar issues are shared by Nova and possibly other projects.\n<br \/><br \/>This session goal is to share different use cases for such API, discuss the design and come up with an implementation plan.

This hesitation has a negative affect on both the Community member's productivity and slows progress on the OpenStack code base.

As usage of container technology moves from an experimental playground to real usage, end users are looking for similar capabilities in container environments to what they had in their VM-centric world. While live migration of containers is still a \"young\" technology via checkpoint\/restore and the Linux CRIU project, we believe showing the \"art of the possible\" in this early phase will be valuable to OpenStack end users and developers. Again, as container use across OpenStack grows, we expect there will be a growing need for live migration capabilities for microservices, applications, containerized OpenStack services, and so on, that are in the future potentially running in containers.<\/p>",

With all the hype, due to security issues, open stack has not totally captured people's mind as the best way to manage IoT devices.

Those new use cases need new networking APIs that are increasingly unlike Neutron, and need to be quickly developed and deployed in order to accelerate time-to-market and improve business agility. In addition, NFV requires the flexibility to use multiple networking back-ends in OpenStack, and to use multiple APIs and back-ends simultaneously.<br \/><br \/>Gluon is a Model-Driven, Extensible Framework of NFV Networking Services that enable Telecom Service Providers to provide its customers with new NFV use cases on-demand. Gluon uses a model-driven approach to generate APIs from a YAML file which models the NFV Networking Service. Applications use those APIs to provide the new service. Thus, Gluon helps Telecom Service Providers accelerate the time-to-market and achieve business agility in NFV domain.<br \/><br \/>This presentation gives an overview of the design and implementation of Gluon.<br \/><\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p><span>Application design, development, and deployment have evolved, but IT is struggling to keep up. The building blocks of the Software defined Architecture and Operations is there, but Operations teams are constrained by brittle management tools. The demands of the new stack have gone beyond a human ability to analyze immense number elements and swiftly take the appropriate course of action. This led Accenture to introduce the \u201cIntelligent Orchestration Platform\u201d. Accenture begins by giving the orchestration platform operational intelligence using data analytics. The addition of intelligence combined with the workflow requirements has created a holistic and enhanced approach to automation and orchestration. These orchestration workflows algorithmically make decisions that solve inefficiencies before they become incidents or problems.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>A preemptible instance is a special kind of instance that can be stopped if there are no resources available for another request with higher priority. This way a user may launch preemptible instances (probably at a fraction of the normal price) to fulfil fault-tolerant tasks (like batch processing), taking into account that they may be terminated without further advise.<\/p>\n<p>With the current OpenStack scheduling mechanism, instances are only spawned if there are enough available resources for. There is no way to prioritise a request against another, and there is no way a request could stop a running instance. When the computing capacity is tight, this situation lead to the underutilization of the infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>This presentation will introduce a PoC for scheduling preemptible instances into nova, developed in the INDIGO-Datacloud project. With this mechanism in place the scheduler can terminate preemptible instances whenever it is needed to allocate free resources for an incoming request.<\/p>",

The purpose is to share knowledge and best practices among cloud operators, as well as provide feedback based on experience running OpenStack. There will be no formal presentations, and a moderate level of knowledge around running OpenStack is assumed.

Service Function Chaining (SFC) addresses these complexities, making even the most complex scenarios quite simple. SFC implemented in an SDN Controller, like OpenDaylight (ODL), must interact with additional components to automate the entire Service Chaining scenario. A VNF Manager, like Tacker, is necessary to manage the life cycle of VNFs. \u00a0Multiple layers need to work in cohesion to make this a reality. This\u00a0ability to support dynamic VNF Forwarding Graphs using Service Function Chaining differentiates various NFV Orchestration stacks out there in the market.<\/p>\n<p>In this talk, you will hear how three opensource projects -\u00a0Tacker,\u00a0Neutron and\u00a0OpenDayLight SDN Controller -\u00a0coming together to achieve this holy grail of the NFV promise.<\/p>",

Do you ever wonder \u201cHow can I can accomplish this with my OpenStack cluster, and what tools will help me do it?\" The closest answer you will find is StackStorm - an open-source, Apache 2.0 Licensed, event driven automation platform. StackStorm is built on the same premises as Facebook\u2019s FBAR and used by many to automate their growing infrastructure, private and public cloud deployments, network infrastructure, security, and operations.<br \/><br \/><br \/>In this presentation, we will give a short overview of StackStorm, and focus on demonstrating two practical applications of event-driven automation with OpenStack.<br \/><br \/><br \/>The first use case is automatic troubleshooting and remediation of OpenStack infrastructure, helping avoid downtime; improving time-to-resolution; and reducing ops teams' pager fatigue. <br \/><br \/><br \/>The second use case provides the flexible and customizable provisioning of L2 networking with OpenStack. You will see how Neutron and StackStorm work together to dynamically provision L2 networks on demand for multi-tenant isolation inside OpenStack.<br \/><br \/>These two use cases only scratch the surface of StackStorm\u2019s capabilities, and we hope StackStorm will unleash your imagination on how event driven automation fits your OpenStack operations, and your overall automation strategy.<br \/><\/span><\/p>",

This session has previously been held in the hallways of every single summit, with rapidly forming and dissolving teams of temporary architects that unfortunately were terrible at taking notes because they were standing in the hallways and trying to get to other sessions. With the ArchWG, we will harness that energy, and coordinate amongst each other to achieve more than just discussions. A face fo face meeting will help us to resolve any need for high bandwidth communication [2], and also help introduce those of us working on it as a primary concern to anyone who wants to contribute to the effort. This will also help us to form more personal relationships that will help make our IRC meetings and mailing list discussions more effective. This is also a chance for summit attendees to bring topics, such as the scaling one below, to the ArchWG for consideration.\n<br \/><br \/>References:\n<br \/>[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/review.openstack.org\/335141\">https:\/\/review.openstack.org\/335141<\/a>\n<br \/>[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Meetings\/Arch-WG\">https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Meetings\/Arch-WG<\/a>\n<br \/><br \/>Session Leader(s): dtroyer, SpamapS",

      "title": "The Race Conditions of Neutron L3 HA's Scheduler Under Scale Performace",
      "description": "<p>Neutron's Router presents a L3 interface that connects VMs to an\u00a0external network. In its legacy mode, a router can be scheduled only to one agent at a time, presenting a single point of failure - if that node fails, all communications are\u00a0halted. L3 HA mitigates this issue by presenting an Active\/Passive configuration where a router can be scheduled to multiple\u00a0agents which\u00a0recover the\u00a0datapath automatically during failures using a dedicated network that hosts keepalived processes.<\/p>\n<p>Using L3 HA presents an orchestration problem: since a router now appears in more than one agent and another dedicated network is\u00a0required\u00a0for the keepalived processes, there are a lot more resources involved. We performed L3 HA scale testing for Liberty and Mitaka, which showed benefits of L3 HA and uncovered a number of race conditions in Neutron code both on L3 agent and on server side. We'll present results of this scale testing and showcase some of these race conditions.<\/p>",

India's growth story has been unprecedented lately fueled by the proliferation of smartphones. Snapdeal is at the center of this digital revolution being the largest e-commerce marketplace in the country. Snapdeal was born in the cloud, but public clouds stops being cost efficient after an inflection point. Last year we decided to build our own private cloud and in a short 10 months period we have successfully built our Hybrid cloud using 100% opensource, with Openstack being at the heart. Our cloud is spanned across 2 Datacenter regions, has highly dense compute architecture with 70000 cores, 10 PB of storage and a 100G SDN infrastructure. We are running on community release of Openstack Kilo customized for our needs. I'll share some of the choices that we have made & the key learnings during this phenomenal journey, followed by a quick demo of our hybrid capabilities.<\/p>",

Public clouds have evolved a lot &amp; with all the hoopla around enterprises moving into public cloud, one would really question the decision of building a private cloud. In our experience building a private cloud can yield great cost savings and performance gains, if executed well. We adopted Openstack because of prior exprience with it &amp; because of no other real alternate to build a large scale IaaS using opensource, with a healthy ecosystem of supported enterprise products. During our early exploration we came across many projects that failed to execute on a similar mission, mainly because they didn't embrace Openstack as opensource and treated it like an enterprise software. In our opinion the only way to be successful with Openstack is by understanding the minute details of the inner workings and code. The community is a great resource to build that knowledge but ultimately the team has to own the software.<\/p>",

I will go\u00a0though the 4 key reasons to build a private cloud and the key principles that we set for ourselves and the capabilities of the cloud platform. I will also explain the design of our Hybrid cloud and how do we plan to operate in a hybrid mode.

      "description": "<p>Nowadays, GPUs have become much more powerful while being energy efficient. With the rise in popularity of 3D applications, growth in Big Data analytics, High Performance Computing, and streaming video, GPUs are being pressed into service to gain performance. Traditionally in virtualization usages, \u00a0a physical GPU is allocated to a VM using PCI device pass-through, an approach that limits resource sharing. However, graphics virtualization support today enables GPU sharing on par with CPU sharing with tenant isolation, enabling cloud workloads to benefit from GPU processing while allowing cloud providers better returns on their infrastructure investments and thus reducing total cost of ownership.<\/p>\n<p>This presentation will introduce how to accelerate GPU intensive workloads in OpenStack with Intel GPU virtualization technology. We shall demo its use in OpenStack. Come learn how to make your cloud richer and even more performant to meet the demands of the workloads of today and tomorrow.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>\"Help: I have Trove deployed, how do I build guest images?\"<\/p>\n<p>This is the #1 question asked by new users of Trove, the OpenStack DBaaS project.<\/p>\n<p>Trove allows users to provision and manage the lifecycle of over a dozen relational and NoSQL databases. To operate Trove, users register guest images for specific database versions, and users can then request instances, replicated pairs, or clusters of those databases. A vital step in making this possible is to build these guest images.<\/p>\n<p>This talk walks users through the process for creating guest images using tools provided by the Trove upstream project. Attendees will learn about the Trove architecture, and learn how to use the OpenStack DiskImage Builder tool to build database images for operation with Trove.<\/p>\n<p>The presenters are Mariam John (of IBM), Amrith Kumar (of Tesora) who are contributors to the Trove project, and Gregory Haynes (of IBM) who is a contributor to the diskimage-builder tool.<\/p>",

It is based on Dataverse, a popular framework for sharing, preserving, and analyzing research data. Cloud Dataverse extends Dataverse to replicate datasets from per-institution repositories to a cloud-based repository and store their data files in Swift, making data processing faster for in-situ application running in the cloud. Cloud Dataverse is a collaborative effort between two open source projects: Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) and Dataverse. Dataverse is being developed at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS) with contributors worldwide providing 19 Dataverse repos hosting 60,000 datasets from 300 institutions deposited by 10,000 data authors.The MOC is a collaboration between higher education (BU, NEU, Harvard, MIT and UMass), government, and industry.Its mission is to create a self-sustaining at-scale public cloud based on the Open Cloud eXchange model<\/p>",

Virtualized and containerised environments using these base systems are being adopted to improve flexibility and manageability of the infrastructure. To this end, the MIKELANGELO project is using a lightweight unikernel (OSv) providing bare minimum, but fully virtualized environment to these workloads. We are going to present a flexible application management that has been implemented specifically to support integration with cloud middlewares, such as OpenStack. This allows dynamic composition and execution of workloads based on user's needs. OpenFOAM CFD is being used to showcase our approach, including an integration into OpenStack dashboard. Finally, we will show how the use of a flexible telemetry system delivers in-depth insights into the infrastructure and application.<\/p>",

Running Kubernetes (an open source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications), on-top of OpenStack has proven to be popular for container management.

Network functions such as DHCP, SNAT, DNAT and L3 routing are typically executed on a network node in a traditional OpenStack environment. OpenSON, however, eliminates the dependency on the network node by implementing those functions as distributed flow rules on virtual switches in the compute nodes hosting relevant virtual machines. As a result, this approach supports better L3 scalability and high availability.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the SDN-based networking approach enables to integrate the control of both overlay networks for virtual networking and underlying physical networks, which enhances the network visibility and facilitates the introduction of network applications such as network monitoring.<\/p>",

But, it&rsquo;s often unclear what&rsquo;s anomalous for a given deployment. Machine learning techniques can help.<\/p>\r\n<p>Contrail Networking provides an Anomaly Detection model based on time-series of any metric. Based on past information, we learn what to expect in the future. If a given metric reports values that are far from this expectation, we raise an Alert.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this example we will use statistical process control, based on computing the running average and standard deviation and examining the current value using real-time stream processing. The metric being used is the number of active flows on the host\/vRouter. We run a multitier application with some clients &ndash; a redmine webserver with a separate mysql database. Then, we launch a TCP SYN attack on the server, which causes an ususual number of flows. This triggers an Alert.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Storage self-service is one of the important tenets of modernizing IT. Storage provisioning typically takes days to weeks time due to the complex approval processes and application requirements getting translated into storage capabilities. Service providers aim to achieve agility, operational efficiency and improved service levels by allowing application and server teams to provision their own storage, on-demand. It allows the storage team to free up critical resources and improves operational efficiency, while maintaining IT control via policies to avoid any erroneous self-service errors.<br \/>In this talk we present how we have used Openstack successfully to enable self servicing and API based automated storage provisioning for one of the largest service provider (IBM Global Technology Services). We will share the lessons learnt from the perspective of IT service provider and many customers across the globe on what has worked well vs what did not work as expected.<\/p>",

Not specific to the Newton release but the speed of development (features) and technical debt, specifically around having a huge repo with a ton of proposed changes but a relatively small active core team, always comes up. At various times different people have proposed different ideas on how to fix the code review latency issue. Ideas include simply scaling the core reviewer team (not having such a high bar to entry), decomposing the repo (breaking out the virt drivers), and subsystem maintainers (people with +2 in certain areas or features of code, but not +2 on the entire repo). This session is really meant to be a discussion between PTLs and core reviewers on various projects to see what ideas teams have tried and what has worked and what has not worked. For example, Neutron did the stadium to mixed results - but unless you are an active developer on Neutron you maybe do not know the details, so what happened? <br \/><br \/>References: <a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/nova-newton-retrospective\">Nova Newton retrospective etherpad<\/a> <br \/><br \/>Session Leader(s): Matt Riedemann (mriedem), Steve Martinelli (stevemar), Doug Hellmann (dhellmann)<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Among the key findings of a recent survey by the OpenStack Foundation was a strong interest among OpenStack users in software-based networking on servers, or server-based networking. But the rapid evolution of cloud-based data centers to support virtualized services in multi-tenant environments requires an increasingly rich set of functionality in the server-based networking data path to support things such as overlay tunneling, distributed security, service chaining, and flow based analytics. This increasing functionality, coupled with ever-increasing speeds and feeds, all while maintaining the flexibility for change, creates the need for a new type of solution: the SmartNIC. <br \/><br \/>There has been a lot of buzz in the industry regarding the use of SmartNICs, also known as intelligent server adapters, in cloud datacenter servers to boost performance by offloading servers from having to perform server-based network data path processing. But what exactly is the definition of a SmartNIC anyway? What are the different models for SmartNIC offload for server-based networking? What are some examples for functions that can be offloaded to the SmartNIC, and how much benefit can be realized over purely software-based approaches? What are some examples of real-life use cases that can benefit from SmartNIC acceleration and offload?<br \/><br \/>This marketplace theater segment will provide a discussion with answers to these questions, and leave you with a better understanding of SmartNICs, their benefits, and their usage in OpenStack cloud networks. \u00a0<\/p>",

Similarly, think of a pool of disaggregated hardware (storage, compute, and networking), from which nodes can be dynamically composed and attached or detached from a cloud customized to a workload. A node for storage would be composed with more Solid State Devices than one for compute. We introduce RedFish API and Intel Rack Scale Design Extensions. We highlight its abilities to compose, boot, monitor, power on and off, create VLANs via the API without directly logging into the Switch. We next share the solution which integrates with Fuel, to deploy an OpenStack cloud and our motivation to develop \u201cRSC\u201d as a project, working with Fuel, Juju, and TripleO, to realize the vision of SDI. You can dynamically grow and shrink clouds, through plugins in Nova, Ironic, Horizon and policies in Congress for increased load or quiet spells.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p><span>As enterprises embrace cloud, they are increasingly looking at options to put some of their workloads on public cloud. Managing multi-cloud environment has been a necessary evil. It usually introduces complexity and results in vendor lock-in.<br \/><br \/>In this talk, we present the use of the OpenStack API layer as the unifying interface for multi-cloud management. In our experience we found that OpenStack API is expressive and powerful. It is able to solve a number of use cases related to managing workloads on public cloud like AWS.<br \/><br \/>We extended the OpenStack control pane by building AWS-specific drivers for Nova, Glance, Cinder and Neutron as a solution to the hybrid cloud complexity. We have included Platform9\u2019s brownfield discovery technology to further ease the ingestion of AWS workloads into an OpenStack-driven cloud.<br \/><br \/>This approach provides a powerful hybrid cloud solution, enabling organizations to standardize on an open standard and reuse the tooling around it for public cloud resources.<br \/><\/span><\/p>",

Following a short overview of the project, this presentation will explain the TaaS service-plugin and TaaS agent\/driver designs and show how they facilitate the implementation of vendor and platform specific extensions. Recent enhancements to the API for supporting asynchronous behavior will also be covered. A discussion on the need for isolating production and mirrored traffic in the physical (underlay) network will follow, during which we will outline the techniques we are pursuing to realize this. We will conclude with a performance analysis of TaaS using different operating modes, platforms and workloads.<\/p>",

It has implemented 5 core projects\u2018 basic commands, and provides a plugin mechanism for other clients to work with it. OpenStack SDK is a library providing APIs for those apps who want to communicate with OpenStack core services. Using OSC and SDK will avoid unnecessary dependency, and obtain well organized commands and APIs.<\/p>\n<p>We have made great progress in these two projects (600+ commits) in 2016. Keystone has deprecated its command client. Nuetron is migrating from Neutron client to OSC. Nova has clarified that Nova client will be deprecated, and suggested to enhance OSC. 17 other projects have implemented their clients as OSC plugin. We also integrated SDK into OSC to implement commands.<\/p>\n<p>OSC PTL Dean shared why we need unified client during the keynotes in Austin, but didn't give much detail. Now, many developers started to use OSC, and joined OSC and SDK community. So, it's time to know the inside of OSC and SDK.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>OpenStack Neutron with ML2 OVS has always been a challenging component in terms of performance and scalability. However, in recent releases, several enhancements and bug-fixes have resulted in significant improvements in overall reliability, performance and scalability of Neutron. In this talk, we will share the results of our testing (both control-plane and data-plane) at large scale and provide a detailed data-driven analysis that explores the true scale limits and bottlenecks of Neutron. We also discuss better ways to tune Neutron configuration parameters for large scale. Moving forward, we expect further improvements based on planned optimizations.<\/p>\n<p>With these changes, is Neutron ready for large-scale production deployments? If customers are planning to deploy vanilla Neutron in their production deployments, what can they expect? How does the reference implementation stack up against other commercial alternatives? These are some of the questions the presentation tries to address.<\/p>",

Those new use cases need new networking APIs that are increasingly unlike Neutron, and need to be quickly developed and deployed in order to accelerate time-to-market and improve business agility. In addition, NFV requires the flexibility to use multiple networking back-ends in OpenStack, and to use multiple APIs and back-ends simultaneously.<\/p>\r\n<p>Gluon is a Model-Driven, Extensible Framework of NFV Networking Services that enable Telecom Service Providers to provide its customers with new NFV use cases on-demand. Gluon uses a model-driven approach to generate APIs from a YAML file which models the NFV Networking Service. Applications use those APIs to provide the new service. Thus, Gluon helps Telecom Service Providers accelerate the time-to-market and achieve business agility in NFV domain.<\/p>\r\n<p>This presentation gives an overview of the design and implementation of Gluon.<\/p>",

The Collaboratory currently stores 500 TB of genomic data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and the dataset is expected to grow to 5 PB by 2018. Software optimized for Ceph storage was designed to authenticate and provide data access to only authorized users, and one project as an early user of the Collaboratory is the PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes, one of the world's largest cancer data analysis initiatives exploring the whole genomes from over 2800 patients across 20 tumor types. The use case further drove the development of Dockstore for sharing workflows as docker containers.\u00a0 The presentation will discuss PCAWG and other use cases on the Collaboratory, performance results and optimization, and lessons learnt from enabling large-scale cancer genomic research on OpenStack.<\/p>",

We also need to make the intentions of the Glance project with respect to glance_store clear.

Simple: You need to make sure your cloud is delivering measurably beneficial outcomes. How?\u00a0we've asked the experts: four OpenStack superusers (each with at least a year's successful experience running OpenStack at scales of 100 to 1,000 physical nodes); we've \u00a0extracted concrete business value metrics, and learned what practices made these users' OpenStack implementations wildly successful.<\/p>\n<p>You can benchmark your own cloud efforts against these metrics, use them to justify an OpenStack project internally to your CXO and demonstrate value to tenants to\u00a0grow internal adoption.

A cloud deployment offers the ability to conveniently scale the cluster as needed. Multi-tenancy is also a big advantage when it comes to facilitating multiple users on the same physical hardware. Furthermore, a cloud deployment, coupled with multi-tenancy, is greatly complimented by the resources and security segregation. Each tenant has full control over their resources without incurring any risk to the resources managed by the other tenants.<\/p>\n<p>Join us and learn how Hadoop can be deployed on an Openstack cloud using the Openstack Sahara project. The presentation will also show how an Openstack cloud can be optimized to get the performance of a Big Data workload on the Cloud to match as closely as possible that on a bare-metal configuration.<\/p>",

Then, you will learn how to extend Tacker's capability by writing\u00a0 custom drivers. A step-by-step procedure of writing a new driver for VNF monitoring, configuration and supporting custom VIMs will be presented.

A significant number of security features are currently available in OpenStack and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data across its services. This presentation illustrates how OpenStack\u2019s existing security features address common security concerns. In particular, we provide an overview of key management, image signing, and block storage encryption. We will cover basic information about how to enable these features and provide a short demonstration. We will discuss how these features individually and collectively secure data in OpenStack. This presentation concludes with an overview of ongoing efforts to add new security features and discusses remaining security gaps that should be addressed.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>We present a solution for a multi-landlord cloud where resources can be combined across deployments.<\/p>\n<p>This model allows each organization to maintain its autonomy by operating its own OpenStack deployment with federated identity. A proxy will replace the Cinder and Glance endpoints in Keystone. When the proxy receives an API call, it determines the location of any objects the API call acts on, and forwards the request to the appropriate deployment using Keystone-to-Keystone authentication. An agent will listen to the messagebus for notifications of newly created resources, learning their location. This allows Nova and Horizon to access resources such as volumes, images and snapshots in other OpenStack deployments.<\/p>\n<p>This solution enables the Open Cloud eXchange model that the Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) project is built on. The MOC is a collaboration between higher education (BU, NEU, Harvard, MIT and UMass), government, and industry.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>As part of an effort to expand access to computing resources, the (US) National Science Foundation XSEDE project has funded several new computational resources with cloud provisioning capabilities \u2013 Bridges and JetStream. To facilitate sharing and reuse of scientific applications, an XSEDE Cloud Virtual Machine Repository has been proposed. Traditional delivery of applications involved monolithic images that requires development, construction, testing, maintenance, vetting, and cataloging of cloud virtual machine images which are non\u00adtrivial tasks. One solution is to use Murano, Heat, and cloud-init scripts to deliver scientific applications on a small number of generic images from Linux distribution maintainers rather than images. The use of standard OpenStack components makes the application repository usable by any standard OpenStack deployment. The details of construction, use, and highlights of a few selected applications will be covered.<\/p>",

Initially, this approach is fast and painless; however, it has shortcomings. The amount of data that must be moved and stored becomes unwieldy making a central shared repository unfeasible. Human intervention is often required to maintain complex scientific application images for updates. This makes application delivery expensive and error prone. Scientific applications are often customized for the underlying hardware making images less portable between clouds. Opaque images means the user must rely on metadata added by the image creator and cannot determine exactly how an image has been customized for their use. These shortcomings can be addressed by using OpenStack components (Murano, Heat, and userdata scripts) to deliver scientific applications on a small generic set of images. A publicly available repository allows contributions and is reusable by other cloud operators delivering scientific applications.<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>This session will connect OpenStack with containers for performance, density and latency sensitive workloads. The excitement around containers has create substantial confusion in the OpenStack community, since there are several different types of container, most of which do not map nicely to core OpenStack concepts. That has led to multiple, immature initiatives to integrate these technologies, and end-user confusion as to the appropriate strategy. In this session we will map out the difference between \"machine containers\" which essentially recreate the hypervisor \/ VM experience, only faster, as defined by LXC, LXD and Solaris zones, and the \"process containers\" defined by Docker and which are best coordinated through higher-level constructs like Mesos, Kubernetes and Docker Data Center. We'll show how Nova-LXD integrates machine containers into OpenStack, preserving the semantics of VMs but giving them the performance, density and latency of bare metal.<\/p>",

MSM provides API consolidation and correlation from Horizon and northbound business support systems and then seamlessly orchestrates OpenStack resources (including user authentication via Keystone) across multiple sites. In addition to using CPLANE\u2019s data center networking for its OpenStack cloud center networking, our Overlay Gateway Router (OGR) provides VXLAN virtual overlay connectivity to the service provider\u2019s wide area network and public clouds.

Enterprises and service providers need an OpenStack orchestration solution that will create an on-demand service that allows them to compete with public cloud services. The on-demand service must easily and reliably integrate with existing OSS\/BSS environments to provide a seamless user experience.

Watcher provides a complete optimization loop. This provides a robust framework to realize a wide range of cloud optimization goals, including the reduction of data center operating costs, increased system performance via intelligent virtual machine migration,increased energy efficiency, etc... Watcher provides several out-of-box optimization routines for immediate value-add, but it also supports a pluggable architecture.\u00a0 The overall goal is that OpenStack-based clouds equipped with Watcher will decrease their Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by way of more efficient use of their infrastructure through targeted optimizations and close-loop automation.<\/p>",

There are severe penalties for breaking GDPR. You are affected even if your company is outside the EU as long as you do business with EU citizens. Cloud is the magic bullet to solving your compliance issues but you need to run it correct to avoid the chopping block. We will look through OpenStack configurations and policies and have a look at what needs to be done and what needs to be changed. We will have a discussion what Privacy by Design means in terms of OpenStack. What can be done within OpenStack itself and what are appropriate steps to take with other tools. How to set up a compliant architecture. All base on real case law. With this session we hope to bring GDPR from the lawyers and in to the Data Center.

The Plasma project in OpenStack has been created to integrate Rack Scale Design with Nova and Ironic to dynamically add and release resources as necessary to meet workload demands. Lenovo is developing new hardware, systems management capabilities, and pluggable interfaces to support RSD and Plasma with collaboration with partners such as Intel and Red Hat.

It is also necessary to provide consistent workload performance in order to achieve consistent service experience. In most cases, the behaviour of workloads is never known prior to the workload being started. Further, the behaviour will change due to resource contention with other simultaneously executing workloads, making resource management a hard problem.<\/p>\r\n<p>Dynamic phase detection helps us determine the current phase of the workload, providing a means to identify the resource consumed in each phase and using this information to manage the performance of the workload by suitably allocating resources to workloads that are under performing.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this session, we will present a workload fingerprinting module implemented within the Watcher framework. We will demonstrate the generation of the fingerprint for a set of workloads running on an OpenStack cluster and visualize the fingerprint.<\/p>",

This means that if a non-operator or OpenStack developer attempts to consume more than a single service from a deployed OpenStack system, they face an uphill battle. With a consumer application requiring potentially 22 individual python-* clients to install, each with different APIs and nuances, it becomes increasingly difficult to consume OpenStack clouds. The python-openstacksdk project proposes a new project with a single API namespace (\"openstack\") that would provide users with a single point of entry and series of supporting functions\/methods from which to build applications and tools. As a side effect of this consolidation, it becomes very easy to derive a unified CLI, such as openstackclient, or specialized per-service CLI tools<\/span><\/p>",

But performance is always the most critical issue when considering big data in OpenStack. In this presentation, we would like to teach you how to configure Hadoop\/Spark in OpenStack. We will use some real customer cases to point out most of the issues that you may concern when running a real big data workload in OpenStack. We did lots of performance testing and would like to show you the results and the gaps between bare metal and virtualization. We also proposed several efficient ways including both OpenStack and Hadoop\/Spark configuration to enhance the performance and reduce the gap to integrate big data services into OpenStack easier.<\/p>",

Some exmaple uses include nova\/neutron testing new releases of libvirt\/ovs *or* testing *OLD* (ie minimum) versions of system tools.  It's designed to use packages to integreate well with devstack (ie we just add the repo and then install_package foo; will give you the version from the alternate repo)  It deliberately seperates the build and install phases for 2 reasons 1) reduces run time and 2) package builing can be hard to automate across large version ranges and multiple OSs.\n<br \/><br \/>ref: <a>http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-October\/105420.html<\/a>\n<br \/>Etherpad: <a>https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/ocata-qa-devstack-plugin<\/a>\n<br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>",

These applications will need higher level of protection via Layer 7 security services like deep packet inspection\/Next Generation Firewalls.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our session will address this lack of L7 Security Policies for Containerized Applications by demonstrating an approach for Kubernetes that can be applied to other COEs (Mesos\/Marathon, Docker Swarm, etc).<\/p>\r\n<p>Kuryr's progress in its mission (to bring Neutron's network capabilities to containers), the recent containerization of Enterprise-grade security functions, and the existence of open-source security orchestrators now provide all the necessary ingredients to L7 security to container workloads. This in turn can speed up adoption of container technology.<\/p>",

The K8s community introduced the ability to express Ingress rules matching Layer 3 and Layer 4 packet headers on traffic between arbitrary sets of Pods (matched by keys\/values in K8s' labeling system). In Kubernetes' case the community is poised to further extend Network Policy in future releases to express Egress rules and QoS requirements, but L7 security is still entirely lacking.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Still up for debate though, is where exactly this compatibility should be focused: at the infrastructure or orchestration level?

At the orchestration layer, we can focus on the interoperability of tools like Terraform and Heat across different clouds to achieve interoperability of your workloads. We\u2019d also like to explore some interesting workload-based scenarios for demonstrating interoperability at both the infrastructure and orchestration levels (as guided by DefCore and tested by RefStack).

And now it seems that more users and operators need to run low-latency or real-time applications (such as audio\/video streaming, highly interactive systems, IoT, HPC, etc.) to meet their requirements in clouds.<\/p>\n<p>This time we we share how to analyze and manage performance issues that users or operators can encounter, showing a framework on performance monitoring. \u00a0Since we are working on Real-time KVM as one of the projects of KVM enhancements for NFV at OPNFV, we share our know-how and experiences to root-cause performance or real-time issues on OpenStack. We use more common cases to make the presentation comprehensive and generic. Typical NFV workloads push the limits in all of the system resource areas: CPU, I\/O, and memory, and our our know-how and experiences should be applicable to common cases.<\/p>",

This 10 minute presentations will delve into the topics and apply some SDN architecture enhancements to Neutron based on the <em>Open Networking Foundation to make Neutron Great Again.<\/em><\/p>",

Additionally, DevOps teams must quickly spin up point-in-time test clouds \u2013 similar to production environments \u2013 to test feature and version releases and ensure reliable software delivery.

      "description": "<p>In computer networking, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the size (in bytes) of the largest packet that can be transferred by an interface without IP fragmentation. The default interface MTU in OpenStack is 1500 bytes. This means, packets with payloads bigger than 1500 bytes are fragmented into multiple smaller packets each with payload 1500 bytes or smaller. At high packet rate, fragmentation adds additional processing overhead on the interface. This reduces performance when the number of packets is scaled.<\/p>\r\n<p>Jumbo frames carry huge packets with up to 9000 bytes of payload. The MTU set to enable jumbo frames is 9000 bytes plus any header size. Enabling jumbo frames reduces fragmentation and the processing overhead of interfaces.<\/p>\r\n<p>This talk explains how to enable jumbo frames in OpenStack Neutron in order to increase scalability and performance at high packet rate. This talk also covers some basic concepts like IP fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery in OpenStack.<\/p>",

So, regardless of OpenStack maturity, we've found multiple problems in our OpenStack system, which often come out as error logs but sometimes not. In the latter case, problems are especially difficult to detect and fix.<\/p>\r\n<p>n this presentation, we will introduce how to manage this problem by utilizing the Elastic Stack, not just parsing error log messages but taking more intelligent approaches. To detect invisible errors and problems, such as performance degradation caused by Keystone, DB and RabbitMQ, we have configured the Elastic Stack to collect log data in a way appropriate for analysis, extracting plenty of important information, e.g. request IDs, request URLs, response times of WSGI servers. We will show how to utilize these data for troubleshooting OpenStack and results of log data analysis in our OpenStack system.<\/p>",

The current answer to all of these questions is the same - become an engineer.<br \/><br \/>What is need is a modular suite of applications that you can grow and sculpt to fit an organization, and then re-sculpt as the needs evolve. <br \/><br \/>This session will show how to make end users productive and how administrators can simplify management and compliance of OpenStack data. <br \/><br \/>Traditional storage requests have become self service, in an intuitive interface, via any OS, device or App. OpenStack Swift is required to offer a similar capability ie. enable users to pick what works best for them, provide the same storage view from anywhere, let users securely share OpenStack data inside and outside a company if that makes the workforce more productive.<br \/><br \/>It is not \u201cIf you build it, they will come\u201d anymore, today we face \u201cIf you don\u2019t, they will go somewhere else.\u201d<\/p>",

It should be possible to stay opened to 'old-style' solutions and in the same time support latest trends in microservicing. The talk will present possible future of datacenter networking platform based on containerized Openstack environment run on Kubernetes cluster. The presentation will show architecture of co-located containers and VMs joined in common networking framework. To enable this, Neutron, Calico and OVS technologies will be explored. We will show how they can be configured to support unified networking. The evaluation of solutions existing on market will lead to assessment of current value and will show needed improvements to achieve common use-cases in both containers and VMs worlds. The requirements to fulfill are HA, multitenancy and exposing services to the Internet access.<\/p>",

Well over half of all contributions have come from a group consisting mostly of new hires. This effort began with three engineers and has since grown to thirty dedicated members in the first half of 2016. Most notably, these results have occurred within the walls of a Fortune 10, historically associated with conservative decisions rather than open source dedication. There is an absolute tide turning in the software culture at AT&T from all levels and it is to that of openness. The presenters in this talk are the original members of AT&T\u2019s Community team. We have gone from fresh OpenStackers to taking on all steps required to contribute and grow the team by ten-fold. We have run the gambit on changing culture and breaking down roadblocks to enable open source efforts. We still have a long way to go, but we know our results and experiences can be invaluable to others in the community.<\/p>",

How can we improve quality of software operations, reduce the cost of automation, and improve our ability to operate across multiple public and private infrastructures? Perhaps open source automation and operations code - with shared development and shared insights - holds the answer. This session will show how companies are collaborating and sharing low-level operations code for much more efficient operations, much faster delivery, and much better ops quality. Gaining the benefits of SAAS as open source is the goal of charms, which are open source operations packages, enabling companies from Box to Sky collaborate on the operation of complex components reliably and at scale, everywhere, from Azure to OpenStack.<\/p>",

On the other hand, containers recently introduced consistent deployment capabilities and container management systems brought robust application lifecycle administration at scale.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we\u2019ve decided earlier this year to bring the worlds of VMs and containers together by containerizing OpenStack services and managing them using Kubernetes. This effort enables companies to deploy a scalable and self-healing OpenStack platform in less than 5 minutes on top of Kubernetes.<\/p>\n<p>During this session, we will share the experience that we gained during the kubification of OpenStack, demonstrate how this work simplifies and accelerate OpenStack deployments and operations, and describe how what was initially a proof of concept is growing into a production-ready product.<\/p>",

Among the obstacles to the adoption of this decentralized model is the development of a convenient and powerful IaaS system capable of managing a significant number of remote data-centers in a unified way.<br \/><br \/>Instead of developing yet another brokering system, the ambition of the WG is to deliver such a system by reusing as much as possible of the OpenStack eco-system.<br \/><br \/>The two first sessions will aim to discuss major use-cases and to identify pros\/cons of current OpenStack solutions to operate massively distributed clouds. The last session will focus on defining actions we should address during the Ocata cycle.<\/p>",

Routed Networks rely on a layer 3 architecture that routes traffic to small segments of the network to achieve scale. This approach serves well deployments where large scale is a paramount requirement and users just need a set of VMs with IP addresses.<br \/><br \/> Routed Networks showcases how technology can be simplified and scaled, two goals that are often difficult to meet together. We hope to inspire architectural decisions that eliminate unnecessary complexity and complicated user experiences.<br \/><br \/> This presentation will include a live demo.<\/p>",

This will allow us to faster work on common requirements and patches. OPNFV developers will be able to submit patches to OpenStack and test them in OPNFV environment. OpenStack developers will benefit from the early testing of their patches together with other OPNFV components using OPNFV test frameworks and CI pipeline running against distributed bare metal labs.<\/p>\n<p>We share experience from setting up the 3rd party CI, explain how the CI systems are connected and discuss benefits for developers and users from both communities.<\/p>\n<p>We explain the difference between OPNFV\u2019s 3rd party CI and typical company 3rd party CI. In OPNFV we do two different things: Besides Helping OPNFV projects to access OpenStack patches using the combined CI pipeline we also establish a service to OpenStack by reusing OpenStack Infra utilities to create OPNFV scenarios like HA and bare metal testing.<\/p>",

Requirements coming from OPNFV are typically implemented in upstream communities like OpenStack but due to the nature of OpenStack, E2E integration is not ideal. Apart from this, not having connection between OpenStack and OPNFV CIs, it takes long time until a patch that is contributed to OpenStack to be integrated with other OPNFV components and can be tested in OPNFV environment. Establishing 3rd Party CI will result in additional feedback loops enabling OPNFV to do the testing earlier and provide feedback faster to both communities.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: black; font-size: 10pt;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>",

The hyper-convergence server is a software-centric architecture that tightly integrates compute, storage, and networking on commodity hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many compute servers in the in data centers have internal storage disks, but block storage is provided by dedicated SANs. As a result, much of the local storage on compute nodes remains underutilized.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceph stores data on distributed commodity servers and provides interfaces for object and block storage. While Ceph is often run on dedicated servers, it can make more sense to converge OpenStack compute and Ceph on the same nodes and employ the unused local hard disks as drives for Ceph OSDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Converged Ceph can significantly reduce storage costs in comparison to proprietary iSCSI arrays. It allows for a scalable storage infrastructure that grows as compute capacity increases, and eliminates the need for dedicated Block storage system.<\/p>",

When running with Distributed Virtual Routing (DVR) enabled, additional IP allocations are done for each compute node, which can quickly increase the number of addresses required into the thousands.<\/p>\n<p>A new concept is being introduced in Neutron to allow a subnet to be labelled with a &quot;service type&quot;, such that IP allocations for router ports can use subnets that do not contain Internet-routable addresses, leading to a substantial decrease in usage.<\/p>\n<p>In this session we will describe what a Subnet Service Type is, how they can be used in a large-scale deployment to reduce Public IP Address consumption, and do a short demo on the new commands and usage.<\/p>",

We applies the continuous data protection technology in OpenStack to provide second level recovery of the disk in the virtual machine based on KVM.

      "description": "<p>Companies moving to provide cloud services for their lines of business are faced with a growing number of technology choices ranging from the choice of cloud computing platforms to application deployment based on virtual machines or containers and microservices. The speed at which the industry is advancing makes it difficult to distinguish between the hype and the reality of many of the new technology choices, which may often appear to be at odds with each other.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the OpenStack community is where we can explore new models and share our experiences of what works and what does not. Based on the work being done at Cisco and SAP, this talk will address how containerization of OpenStack services using Docker, Ansible, Kolla, and Kubernetes makes it easier for a small team to bring consistency and management to OpenStack services for both service providers and enterprise data centers.<\/p>",

One of the biggest use-case\u00a0is OpenStack integration as network virtualization. So the\u00a0OpenDaylight community has spent much effort on this use case along\u00a0side with neutron community. In OpenStack netwon cycle we've made big\u00a0progress in neutron driver. Basically networking-odl push down\u00a0information from neutron to opendaylight. However syncing state in\u00a0distributed environment is challenge. In the past there are related\u00a0issues due to race condition, ha issue. In order to resolved it, new\u00a0framework has been introduced which is called v2 driver framework.\u00a0The basic idea comes from log replication and applied it to the case\u00a0of netuorn-opendaylight. But it needs to be realized without using\u00a0another big component so that DBMS is the only choice. In this\u00a0session, its motivation and technical details will be discussed, and\u00a0the current status and future plan will be shown.<\/p>",

This is critical for apps handling sensitive data and have to comply with regulatory policies where basic iptables (Neutron Security Groups) is not enough. Using physical appliances is not an option as it requires inflexible complex network design and disrupts automation.<\/p>\r\n<p>Intel OSC has evolved to tackle this very challenge and simplifies the task of managing security by providing a single plane of glass to orchestrate multiple security services within Openstack. In this session we will describe and demonstrate how the OSC can orchestrate multiple security services and enable security service function chaining based on the pre-defined security policy.<\/p>",

This talk will describe how an OpenStack micro-segmentation framework using eBPF can be utilized for analytics and tracing to secure application workloads. Use cases around application security, intrusion detection using service insertion, identity will be described. While networking is one piece of the solution, sandboxing applications to avoid attacks is also important. We will also touch upon how eBPF technology and a unified policy framework can secure application workloads in areas beyond networking.<\/span><\/p>",

This session will focus more on what we plan to support for upgrades, and how those will be implemented. \n<br \/><br \/>Questions to discuss in this session:\n<br \/><br \/>1) How do we roll out newer versions of COEs faster? Currently, we bake Docker into the image. Should we continue this practice? Building new images could make our project iteration slower, but deployments are faster when this is set up in the image in advance. Should we try to strike a balance between the two choices? If so, how?\n<br \/><br \/>NOTE: Creating an Fedora Atomic image with the current docker version is trivial and is done automatically. However, if you want to install a version of docker that is NOT in the current fedora release it IS very difficult.\n<br \/><br \/>NOTE: If we continue using Fedora Atomic, we will follow the stable release of that project, not intermediate and experimental midpoints.\n<br \/><br \/>NOTE: SECURITY WARNING: Using non-distro packages is not the best practice for installing important components, such as Docker, as blindly piping shell code from the internet through <i>sudo<\/i> should terrify us all. Also, if we no not use the upstream Atomic versions of Docker, we lose the SELINUX patches provided by RedHat.\n<br \/><br \/>2) How should we support upgrading COEs?\n<br \/><br \/>3) How should we support upgrading Infrastructure (Cloud Resources such as Nova instances) that compose a Magnum cluster?\n<br \/><br \/>4) Should we Replace the heat agent with a magnum-specifc agent for handling lifecycle operations (like Trove has).

      "description": "<p>Crystal is the first open and extensible Software-Defined Storage architecture for OpenStack Swift. Crystal provides simplified policy-based storage management to system administrators in an \"If-This-Then-That\" (IFTTT) form. These policies can change the behavior of \u00a0the system by transparently intercepting object requests with storage transformations or filters (\"That\"). The enforcement of filters may be static or dynamic based on monitoring metrics (\"This\"). Crystal's dashboard extends Horizon for enabling administrators to write policies and monitor the system.<\/p>\n<p>Crystal integrates several storage filters and monitoring metrics that demonstrate its feasibility. For instance, Crystal handles policies that enforce data compression or caching on object requests based on a container's activity, or it can enforce multi-tenant bandwidth differentiation.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, both storage filters and inspection metrics can be plugged-in at runtime to extend the system's capabilities.<\/p>",

In this presentation, its main contributors will explain how it leverages the specialized nature of both cloud and bare-metal event workloads to filter only those events who are relevant to a specific process (e.g. billing, platform health checks etc.)<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Come and learn about the Ironic team\u2019s efforts in making upgrade testing (Grenade) work. We will be discussing all the various obstacles and pitfalls that we ran into in getting Grenade to work for the Ironic project. Most everyone agrees that cloud upgrades need to be smooth, quick and reliable, with no downtime for data or the control plane. During the active code development processes it is very easy to break upgradability even with small changes. By adding larger features it becomes more likely. Ironic has become an actively developed project and in every release there are many new features added to Ironic. The Ironic Community decided that automated testing of upgrades was the #1 priority for Newton cycle. In this session, we will tell about the basic concepts of the testing of upgrades at the gates with help of Grenade. We highlight the difficulties faced by the Ironic team. Finally we will list what's currently being worked on and we'll look at the rolling upgrades roadmap.<\/p>",

We will delve into the future of RCA, exploring project Vitrage and the challenges ahead, discussing the compelling need for RCA automation in order to facilitate fault management. We will also address issues including when RCA should be undertaken, and what are its goals, various accepted methodologies for achieving efficient, effective fault management and possible roles RCA has in OpenStack. Vitrage is a new OpenStack project dedicated to RCA and deduced insights into the behavior of the Cloud. With the help of a graphical model representing the different relationships between system entities, and a friendly UI, Vitrage hopes to achieve its mission of organizing, analyzing and visualizing a holistic view of the system.\u00a0 Several central issues will be discussed, including role-based views of RCA, alarm aggregation, RCA history, multi-layered RCA and much more.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>",

Template based orchestration alleviates this problem, as new features become available, the new network services can take advantage of them by requesting these new capabilities in the network service descriptors using Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA). Thus, APIs can be kept simple and drivers for different orchestrators\/managers\/controllers need no changes. In a large distributed infrastructure however it is not manageable to keep track of the capabilities and provide capability matching for network functions, links, connection points, and VNF forwarding graphs. A new service layer is needed for such capability matching, generating domain specific orchestration templates, and distributing them. Domino project addresses this use case.<\/p>",

From 6WIND&rsquo;s experiences, we have seen some lab trials which require many weeks before having an environment that is high performance ready.<\/p>\r\n<p>Most of the engineering efforts are spent in setting up the nodes because of the constraints related to DPDK powering the NFVi virtual switching: setting up the proper DPDK PCI NICs, configuring the vSwitch VLAN or VXLAN, setting scenarios like DVR, trying to debug with tools like tcpdump, getting a SDN controller into the game, and provisioning the security groups.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beyond 2016, getting a rapidly-running NFVi environment will become critical to the success of deploying NFV.

It is installed into commodity Linux servers to provide a scalable, reliable and manageable storage pool consisting of internal disk drives. It can run on not only dedicated servers but also Nova Compute ones so as to deploy hyper-converged infrastructure. With Sheepdog, you can launch your own cloud storage small then scale it out flexibly to fit your business growth.<\/p>\r\n<p>This talk will present how to use Sheepdog as Cinder\/Glance backends, beginning with minimal installation then extending it. It will also cover recent topics in development and use cases. This introduction is good for attendees who find another way to build your own cloud storage.<\/p>",

To help empower end-users and make the data more valuable, indexing metadata that resides in Swift makes for a very powerful solution in a large amount of use-cases. Marrying object storage, and it's native metadata capabilities, with indexing technologies like Elasticsearch greatly simplifies and enhances the data and makes it more valuable and actionable. In this session we will provide examples of how to work with metadata in Swift, indexing it all, and searching across your pool of valuable data.<\/span><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>We present Arrebol, a service for the easy execution of Bag-of-tasks (BoT) applications in private, public and hybrid clouds. Arrebol provides an intuitive scripting language to define large BoT jobs in a succinct way. Using a command line interface, users can submit jobs to the Arrebol submission service. It parses the jobs and interacts with the underlying cloud to create the infrastructure required to run them. Then, it submits tasks to execute in parallel, and dismantles the infrastructure when it is no longer needed, making the management of the execution of jobs completely transparent to the users. BoT applications are ideally suited to be executed over elastic cloud infrastructures. We also discuss how Arrebol leverages Fogbow, a middleware for federating clouds, to increase the capacity of the infrastructure by exploiting different hybrid settings, including cloudbursting and cloud federation. Both Arrebol and Fogbow are available as open source under Apache 2.0 license.<\/p>",

This makes them very easy to execute in parallel. It suffices to implement a workqueue scheduler that keeps submitting tasks to any virtual machine (VM) that is available. The more VMs available, the faster the job will complete. Unfortunately, the number of VMs that a user can simultaneously create in a private cloud is regulated by quite restrictive quotas, compared to the ideal number of VMs required to run a large BoT job fully in parallel. We explain how we address both issues. On one side, we use Arrebol to facilitate the description of large BoT jobs, and to transparent manage their execution on a cloud infrastructure. On the other side, we use Fogbow to increase the size of the infrastructure that Arrebol can use to run jobs for its users. This is done though either cloudbursting the excess demand to public clouds, or by leveraging on a federation of private clouds. <\/span><\/p>",
      "attendees_expected_learnt": "<p>Attendees with interest in executing large BoT jobs on a cloud infrastructure will learn how Arrebol can be used to substantially simplify this task. They will learn how BoT jobs are described, and how Arrebol can be deployed at their local site. They will also learn how jobs can be submitted, have their progress monitored, and killed, if required. Then, they will learn Fogbow\u2019s philosophy for cloud federation, how a Fogbow federation can be setup, and how Fogbow can be used to implement simple hybrid clouds where excess demand is automatically, but under the control of the cloud administrator, cloudburst to public clouds. They will have a clear idea of the effort required to deploy Fogbow atop an existing cloud. Finally, they will also learn how Fogbow can be used to federate opportunistic clouds, whose working nodes are shared desktops that are made available for being used in the cloud when they are deemed to be idle, or with a load that is sufficiently low.<\/p>",

With Cloud Native applications built by composing\u00a0microservices, the ability to control traffic as it flows among these services becomes critical.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Kubernetes Network SIG worked over last year to define Network Policy with the ability to control traffic among containerized services. At the same time, open source projects Kuryr and MidoNet have been advancing to achieve network security for containers in a simplified, distributed architecture. Removing architectural bottlenecks, Kuryr + MidoNet efficiently implement security policies through the hardened Neutron framework for use by containers in large scale environments. In this talk, we will discuss the latest updates of the Kubernetes Network SIG group, insert Neutron as a networking framework, and explore Kuryr and MidoNet networking solutions with advanced use cases.<\/p>",

We enhanced the design of storage availability zones as failure domains and allowed for them to be consistent with Nova and Neutron availability zones.<\/p>\n<p>We will discuss use cases and demonstrate the use of these features while indicating best practices and troubleshooting tips that might come in handy when using both these features in your data center.

When taking down storage systems for maintenance, decommissioning or updating old storage technologies, cloud operators need to move data around between storage systems. For the purposes of providing a highly available storage system or simply protecting user data, they employ storage specific replication tools. Operators spend a lot of time in configuring these tools to the heterogeneous storage portfolio within the clouds that they administer. As a software defined storage abstraction, manila is already in a place to provide common abstractions. In this release, a lot of work has gone into introducing and improving the share migration and share replication features. Some of these changes introduce a shift in architecture of the manila project, such as introducing a scalable data copy service that is meant to solve many more exciting use cases for manila users\/administrators.<\/span><\/p>",

The Quality of Service (QoS) effort leading up to Liberty prompted the creation of an L2 agent extension mechanism in order to provide a defined ability for agent extensions to be added to the neutron-openvswitch-agent. Other Neutron L2 agents, such as neutron-linuxbridge-agent and neutron-sriov-agent, have since been modified to utilize this extension mechanism. In the Newton cycle, this framework was generalized and implemented in Neutron's L3 base agent, with FWaaS' v2 implementation as the initial subscriber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>This talk will discuss:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul><li>The history of agent extensions in Neutron.<\/li>\n<li>A deep dive into how they function.<\/li>\n<li>Various use cases that take advantage of them.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><span><br \/><\/span><span>We will review a selection of the current use cases for agent extensions.

For example, you may want to compare and validate the performance of certain workloads on your cloud after an update. In this talk, we detail how we can leverage three open source tools to easily satisfy this need.<br \/><br \/>1. <em>Google PerfKit Benchmarker<\/em>: A benchmarking tool geared towards data plane performance measuring. This is in contrast to Rally, a Benchmark-as-a-Service project for OpenStack, which is more for control plane performance at this time. Out-of-the box, PerfKit can run nearly 30 popular micro-benchmarks and workloads, and supports ten different cloud platforms including OpenStack.<br \/><br \/>2. <em>Elasticsearch<\/em>: A search engine that stores and indexes JSON documents.<br \/><br \/>3. <em>Kibana<\/em>: An interface plugin that provides visualization capabilities on top of the data indexed by Elasticsearch.<br \/><br \/>Join us to discover how you can use these tools for your performance analysis!<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Take a survey of scientific computing practitioners for a definition of HPC and you will undoubtedly end up with a broad picture encompassing various shapes, sizes and domains of individual and ensemble jobs. Ask about the storage needed to support these workloads and you\u2019ll find they all need a high-performance filesystem (HPFS) designed for parallel access.<\/p>\n<p>OpenStack is now a hot topic in the HPC world. Whether it\u2019s using OpenStack as a bare-metal provisioning service or looking to offer a flexible, integrated IaaS close to primary HPC. However, the question of how to integrate a HPFS with OpenStack is not yet well answered. Little wonder it was one of the priority areas surfaced by the Scientific WG in Austin. In this talk architects and operators from Cambridge University in the UK and Monash University in Australia will explain their approaches to integrating Lustre and OpenStack, the tradeoffs involved, the gaps remaining, and share performance data.<\/p>",

Building and growing this amazing group has been a result of the very deliberate efforts of some extremely dedicated people, as well as crucial community tools like GitHub, IRC, Stack Overflow, Google Hangout, and Twitter. Great OpenStack meetups are powerful. They foster a collaborative, inclusive environment,\u00a0focused on important issues to the developers and users who make OpenStack tick.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In this continuation of a talk that began at OpenStack Summit Austin, hear what\u2019s made four of the leading meetup organizers in the U.S. so successful and how you can translate that success to your local meetups. They\u2019ll cover the logistics of having sponsors as speakers, explore the pros and cons of streaming live meetups, talk about how to diversify our community, and answer all of your burning questions.<\/p>",

Magnum allows native API access directly to COEs, so this means having a way to revoke or re-issue a TLS certificate used by the COE. Today, the only option is to delete the bay and create a new one. We'd like to add a feature to Magnum that keeps the data plane in place, but revokes or replaces certificates in place. We realize that revoking individual user certs from a cluster might require contributions to upstream k8s and swarm projects, and potentially other driver types as well. Should we consider forming teams to contribute to these projects?\n<br \/><br \/>See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/barcelona-2016\/summit-schedule\/events\/16880\/kubernetes-openstack-special-interest-group-sig\">Kubernetes OpenStack SIG session Tuesday, October 25, 2:15pm-2:55pm<\/a>\n<br \/>See also: <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.kubernetes.io\/2016\/04\/introducing-kubernetes-openstack-sig.html\">kubernetes-openstack special interest group<\/a>\n<br \/>",

Our goal is to select criteria by which supported versions will be included with Magnum going forward. We may use distro packages or not (concerns only the container engine). We expect that using distro packages may cause us to lag a git on docker version upgrades, BUT should offer more stable and secure, selinux fixes and other patches carried by Red Hat. Using docker's repos may be faster but the packages are not as reliable as RedHat's.\n<br \/>Kubernetes can be provisioned by putting k8s into docker containers to keep them current more quickly and easily.\n<br \/><br \/>See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/barcelona-2016\/summit-schedule\/events\/16953\">Cluster Upgrades<\/a>",

The purpose is to share knowledge and best practices among cloud operators, as well as provide feedback based on experience running OpenStack. There will be no formal presentations, and a moderate level of knowledge around running OpenStack is assumed. If you're just starting out, the Operations Track of the conference will be much more friendly!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>",

In 2007 I held a research associate position at the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), where I started to work with virtualization so as to deliver on-demand services. I have taken part in several European projects about distributed and Grid and Cloud computing, such as EGEE-II\/III (FP6, FP7), Int.Eu.Grid (FP6), EUFORIA (FP7), EGI-InSPIRE and more recently EGI-Engage and INDIGO-Datacloud.<\/p>\r\n<p>With the advent of Cloud computing I moved towards this field, working in the adaptation of the current Cloud middleware and infrastructures to fit the specific needs (parallelism, performance) of the scientific computing applications. In fact the CSIC deployed one of the first OpenStack infrastructures in Spain, back in the Essex release. I am a member of the Openstack<br \/>foundation, and I have been an Active Technical Contributor for several cycles, even if my activity has been related with bugfixing .<\/p>",

In 2010 he switched roles to lead the design and architecture function with a focus on the enterprise data centre. In this role he introduced a basic IaaS using what was DynamicOps and is now VMware\u2019s vRA product, this reduced the delivery time of virtual servers from 5 days to 5 minutes and, I am happy to say, is still running and providing an enterprise focussed IaaS.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014 Smith persuaded the management team at Sky that the future of the IaaS in the data centre was OpenStack and was given the massive opportunity to start a new team focussed on introducing OpenStack into the enterprise. This has been a tremendous success, which is mainly due the outstanding team at Sky and great software. We have significantly reduced the delivery time of servers, networks and storage and can now spin up whole application and database stack in minutes using standard and portable OpenStack APIs.<\/p>\n<p>Being an keen programmer he has always strived to make writing and deploying successful applications as seamless and effortless as possible. This interest led to PaaS solutions and around 5 years ago we worked with the VMware team on Cloud Foundry implementations which at the time were unsuccessful. He is pleased to say Sky now has a successful implementation of Cloud Foundry and he now leads the OpenStack and Cloud Foundry teams, defining the strategy for cloud infrastructure and delivering solid self service data centre solutions based on open source technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of architecting and implementing the latest data centre technologies I am an avid follower of MotoGP and WSB along with the local UK BSB championship, doing geek programming (mainly in Python - he has to do this in secret!), and playing the guitar (badly). He lives with his wonderful family, Stephanie, Ella and Sydney (the dog), who you will find walking with him in all weather conditions along the bank of The Thames in West London.<\/p>",

Initially focused on Windows and Unix\/Linux systems management and ITSM.<br \/> <br \/> Though, as I enjoy presenting and meeting people the lions share of my career has been in Pre-Sales roles, this background then affording me the opportunity to join SUSE over 5 years ago.&nbsp; Working as UK SUSE Solutions Architect and since January 1st, I have now happily become the full time EMEA Lead Solutions Architect for SUSE OpenStack Cloud (which I have been doing part time for nearly two years).<br \/> <br \/> I am a keen advocate of Open Source and standards for what this offers to society as a whole and I am frequently involved in Meetups on related subjects, having presented at the London, Netherlands and Oslo OpenStack Meetup's and more general Linux sessions.&nbsp; I was also able to speak at the Openstack Benilux, Paris\/Austin conferences in 2014\/16 and at recent OpenStack days in Hungry and Ireland.<br \/> <br \/> As a family man I also feel passionate that we need to help educate our next generations and have spoken on these topics at some UK universities, hoping to keep the momentum Open Source has achieved going.<br \/> <br \/> Away from technology I am a keen on sport, I still play (and coach a little) the wonderfully eccentric sport of Cricket for a local team and though my football playing days are long gone I content myself by being a long suffering Hull City FC fan and helping out for my sons under 7's side at the weekend.<br \/> <br \/> I try to stay fit to allow me to Snowboard as much as I can (though the family means this isn't as often as I would like) and have competed at a reasonable level in Swimming and Triathlons in the past.&nbsp; Which has combined with my interest in charity support, where I arranged an international bike ride by my cricket team in 2014 to raise money for the Poppy Appeal in the UK.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> I have also volunteered to help larger events, being lucky enough to have been part of the \"Games Makers\" at the fantastic London 2012 Olympiad and a \"Tour Maker\" for the Grand Depart of La Tour when it was in Yorkshire, UK in 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> When I'm not doing all that I love live music, attending festivals when I can.&nbsp; I read often, particularly enjoying history having even been a voluntary archaeologist in Cypress when I was (much) younger.<\/p>",
