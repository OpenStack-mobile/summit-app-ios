			"description": "<p><a href=\"https://commandpresenceworkshop.eventbrite.com\">RSVP Required</a>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Command Presence Workshop</strong> has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.  It is intended to teach participants how to handle “senior-level high pressure meetings”.  The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event.  In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides.  Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins.  There is a role-play simulation. It is not uncommon to hear occasional “gasps” of disbelief from the participants.  The workshop participants will experience rapid-fire questioning, interruption, and other situations that occur in senior-level meetings, but in a safe environment conducive to learning techniques for handling such situations. This will be a great session.</p>\n<p><strong>Facilitators</strong>: Ruchi Bhargava (Intel), Malini Bhandaru (Intel) and a panel of leaders representative of the OpenStack leadership in the community (business leaders and technical leaders).</p>",

The educational program requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the project’s technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session, the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaining problems they might have.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px; color: #666a73; font-family: &#039;Benton Sans&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full two-day training session.</span></p>",
