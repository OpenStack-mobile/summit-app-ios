The educational program requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the project\u2019s technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session, the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaining problems they might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px; color: #666a73; font-family: &#039;Benton Sans&#039;, &#039;Helvetica Neue&#039;, Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full two-day training session.<\/span><\/p>","start_date":1461510000,"end_date":1461531600,"location_id":42,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":4.6,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upstream-university-openstack-summit-austin-tickets-22669105906","level":"Beginner","track_id":41,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"speakers":[{"id":63,"first_name":"Marton","last_name":"Kiss","title":"GM of Europe, Aptira","bio":"<p>OpenStack Ambassador, founder of Hungarian OpenStack user group, co-organizer of OpenStack CEE Day event and active contributor of multiple OpenStack projects.
