An open, agile, and cloud native model will enable Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to innovate, deploy, and manage new services. HPE, in partnership with Red Hat, offers a new way for CSPs to design, deploy, and manage networking services from the Core out to the Edge. The new HPE NFV Blueprints are validated reference designs that come with toolset that leverages open industry standards like Redfish to automate deployment and configuration of the NFVI stack. They help reduce complexity, lower risk, and enable faster time to value for CSPs to deploy their Telco NFV- Infrastructure. By decoupling the network functions from proprietary hardware appliances and embracing virtualization and open industry solutions, CSPs can accelerate new, compelling services in an efficient, cost‐effective model.<\/p>",

Furthermore, many also seek policy-compliant safe spaces to compute on sensitive or protected data.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>To cater to these users, the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute deployed an OpenStack cloud called Stratus.

			"description": "<p>Managing OpenStack environments requires visibility and observability. However many OpenStack deployments have limited monitoring tools and as a result enginteers lack visibility into the workings of the OpenStack environment. In this track you will learn about an OpenStack native monitoring tool called Monasca (Monitoring As A Service At Scale) that provides visibility into OpenStack environments. Monasca provides visibility of compute, block storage, image service, authentication, networking, and more. <br /><br />In this presentation we plan to cover:<br /><br />- A tour of OP5's implementation of Monasca<br />- How to deploy Monasca on bare metal and within OpenStack<br />- Best practices for OpenStack monitoring<br /><br />About OP5<br /><br />OP5 has developed an enterprise level monitoring solution with full support for OpenStack. It is based upon the OpenStack project Monasca, meaning a high performing scalable fault tolerant solution from start.<br /><br />Monasca is based on microservice architecture which enables high scalability, both horizontally and vertically, and as a result OP5's monitoring solution is able to process millions of metrics per second.<br /><br />OP5's monitoring solution for OpenStack can also handle constant data streams being both pulled and pushed from within the environment. The architecture is built on a highly-performant message bus capable of ingesting a constant flow of data streams as opposed to a master-slave polling for events.<br /><br />Our solution supports agent authentication through Keystone, a OpenStack authentication project. The use of tenants make it possible to separate authentication and authorization on a per-project-basis, and It makes it possible to separate departments or customers sharing the same platform, giving a reliable, multi-tenant solution.<br /><br />In the same vein as OP5's other monitoring solutions, this is based upon robust APIs enabling integrations with other applications for analytics and visualization, such as Grafana.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p class=\"p1\">We've all read the news how AWS is making all other clouds irrelevant, and the naysayers around private cloud. But the research data and customer implementation reality just do not match that hype. What is the truth about public versus private versus hybrid cloud? What are customers really trying to do, and how does OpenStack fit in? This session will answer those questions and more, walking through what's real and what's hype and show how customers are using OpenStack to not only solve real-world problems and power next-generation applications, but also how it's a critical part of a hybrid cloud infrastructure. You will learn how to align workloads to the right infrastructure and how to develop a cloud strategy that works for your organization. The speaker has been in the cloud computing space for nearly a decade and will bring that context to bear. This is a vendor agnostic session that will include customer case studies and global research results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> <\/span><\/p>",

The cloud providing 2600 cores and 7.3 PB of object storage is now home to 90 users and 35 research projects from four continents, and in August 2017 it started a cost recovery phase in order to maintain the sustainability of the project.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />In this talk we will present our environment and focus on how a team of two people manage and monitor it.<br />We will cover the open source tools used for automated testing of the core functionality provided by the cloud, performance monitoring, capacity planning, alerting and the integration work we did to get everythng working using entirely free and open source solutions.<br />Based on the lessons learned after operating a publicly facing cloud environment for almost three years, this presentation will have something new for both Openstack beginners and veterans.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

			"description": "<p><span>Mentoring has always been a big part of the OpenStack Community and the time has come for changes. Historically, the Women of OpenStack have owned and run the mentoring program that our community offers to new comers. However, in order to reach a wider audience and to remove any thoughts that the program was women only, we are looking to move the Long Term Mentoring program out from under the Women of OpenStack to a new home. Potential groups that already exist that could own/help manage it are: First Contact SIG or Diversity WG. <br /><br /> In addition to a new overlord, the format of the program itself could use updates. Previously, there was a 1 mentee to 1 mentor ratio that would often struggle for want of a defined goal and slow downs when the mentor would switch jobs or be on vacation. The proposed new format will use cohorts to mentor community members and help them to would require fewer overall mentors helping mentees work towards a defined common goal. <br /><br /> So what does this mean for you? We need one or more volunteers to help get the new program off the ground and oversee the new mentoring program. To be involved from the ground up- helping design what it should look like, what goals are, recruiting mentors and mentees- and continuing to support the program into the future.<\/span><\/p>",

With things like elastic recheck, subunit2sql, openstack-health, and grafana we've got an increasing number of tools to track results and provide insights into what's happening in the gate. But, even with all this data capture a great deal of the analysis has to happen by hand in these systems. Either by identifying things to track or combing through the data to find points of interest. It would be great if we could automate as much of that as possible, which is an a good application for machine learning.<br /><br /> This session is about bootstraping a community effort to build tooling to apply machine learning techniques to our CI results analysis to provide useful insights in an automated manner.<\/span><\/p>",

Security Monkey can be easily extended/customized and provides a dashboard to view open issues and the overall security posture of monitored OpenStack projects.

			"description": "<p class=\"p1\">Containers provide a compelling alternative virtualization for modern application development. OpenShift running on OpenStack allows combining the exposition of resources in the infrastructure layer such as network, compute and storage, provided by OpenStack, with in the consumption of these resources from the platform side by OpenShift. One of the many benefits of running OpenShift on OpenStack is the ability to deploy containers on bare metal using OpenStack Ironic. Different applications have varying performance requirements, many of them benefiting from running on bare metal. The density of containers per node and the scalability of bare metal nodes hosting containers can be orchestrated by OpenShift and OpenStack Bare Metal. In this session you will learn how OpenShift Container Platform is used with Red Hat OpenStack Platform and its Bare Metal service, maximizing container performance and application scalability in the private cloud.<\/p>",

This setup eases the burden of user account administration within OpenStack providing users access to the Horizon dashboard and OpenStackClient tools using existing FreeIPA credentials. We describe the development of a self service web portal for users to manage an API key, a new authentication plugin for keystone, and integrating an OAuth2/OpenID consent endpoint for FreeIPA. Access control is provided by a custom ACL extension in the federated keystone driver pulling groups and projects directly from FreeIPA. This work is supported by Aristotle, a NSF DIBBs funded federated cloud consortium and SUNY at Buffalo's LakeEffect cloud.<\/p>",

SPP is implemented on DPDK. It behaves like a patch panel and enables VNFs to communicate each other.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We also mention the remaining tasks for optimization and how they are going to be solved in the Placement, a resource management service from the Nova project.<\/span><\/p>",

It focuses on introducing DPDK as a technology, its core components, and explaining how it can be used in an Openstack deployment to improve the network virtualization. The presentation illustrates the layout of a DPDK enabled openvswitch deployment explaining how packets flow within this layout and where performance improvements are achieved.

The world that lead to the emergence of the tenets laid out in the GFS and Map Reduce papers has seen a dramatic transformation, with over a decade of hardware improvements. Disaggregation of compute and storage is now commonplace, championed by organizations like Netflix, Amazon, and Airbnb. Pushing storage down a layer and treating it as an infrastructure service allows data platform teams to focus on increasing the pace of innovation higher up the stack.<\/p>\n<p>Engineers building data platforms on OpenStack clouds expect a varity of storage services. Object storage is increasingly becoming the centerpiece of data platforms, as it enables in-situ analysis from elastic workload clusters, low cost, and massive scalability. The presentation will detail object storage centric data platform architectures, and how to build rock solid storage services suitable for data intensive applications.<\/p>",

In this talk, we propose a framework where 3rd party vendor drivers are built as a layer on top of Kolla’s core containers. This solution allows vendors to determine how their containers are built and managed while continuing to stay out-of-tree. With this solution, OpenStack operators can still utilize the power of Kolla’s installer infrastructure to install these containers and also integrate into its configuration framework. The solution does not involve using OpenStack CI to build these 3rd party container images.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>In this talk, we will explain the best practices to containerize OpenStack vendor plugins and use vendor hardware or vendor NFV and use 3rd-party CI to gate them with OpenStack using Kolla and do a cool demo at the end!<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <span>Bring your hardware, and we'll conainerize its plugins for OpenStack!<\/span><\/p>\n<p> <\/p>",

The integration is about bringing isolation and hard multi-tenancy to Kubernetes, and also, make it possible to run privileged workloads in Linux containers at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">The presentation will introduce how frakti version 2 becomes a unified multi-tenancy enabled kubernetes CRI runtime based on Kata Containers.<\/span><\/p>",

			"description": "<p>Much of the recent acceleration and advancement in the devops tooling landscape and community has some relation to the increased adoption of and evolution of the public Cloud. And yet, the Cloud is still in its infancy, and will continue to evolve at a rapid pace, changing how we look at, consume and find new opportunities in its ecosystem. How does this inform the opportunities in devops? Do the profiles of the users we prioritize change? What are the things we need to do well as the consumption of Cloud hits new scales and organizations approach it fundamentally differently? In this talk, I share thoughts on the kinds of change in Cloud that the Spinnaker team is prioritizing as signals, what we see as the things that we need to do well in the near to mid term, and some tangible things we are working on in line with those observations.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p class=\"xmsonormal\">Placement in OpenStack carries two fundamental issues that limit its scalability. First, Nova scheduler is too slow for large clouds, as it requires full knowledge of the system's state for its decisions. Second, the orchestration engine (Heat) enables launching multi-VM cloud applications, but deploys them one at a time since Nova lacks the required application level awareness. This may lead to under-utilization and sub-optimal performance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">This session addresses both issues. We will show a faster alternative to Nova scheduler and an enhancement for application level deployment. Through extensive evaluation on real datasets, we will show that the new scheduler achieves up to x5.3 faster placements with similar quality.  We will also show that our enhancement improves the performance and acceptance ratio of network services.<\/p>",

We will show that the current scheduler does not scale to large clouds, and that the bottleneck is caused by attaining a complete view of the available resources. Instead, we will show an adaptive state caching technique that mitigates the bottleneck while preserving the placement quality.<\/p>\n<p class=\"xmsonormal\">To better support multi-VM applications we will show that placement should be done for the entire application, rather than for each VM individually. This approach increases the resource utilization and optimizes the efficiency of such applications. For example, we will show an algorithm that optimizes performance of NFV service chains via improved placement. In summary, our session demonstrates enhancements to placement, which increase the scalability and efficiency of OpenStack tools.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p>CERN is the home of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a 27km circular proton accelerator generating tens of petabytes of new data every year. Data is stored and processed using a large amount of resources totaling over 250.000 cores and 1000s of storage servers, managed by OpenStack.<\/p>\r\n<p>Networking is a critical part of our infrastructure and arguably the hardest to evolve. Given the size of CERN&rsquo;s infrastructure, its flat network is partitioned in segments each representing a separate broadcast domain and potentially offering different levels of service. This fragmentation improves scalability and reduces the impact of misbehaving systems in the datacentre to individual segments. On the other hand, having multiple broadcast domains means features like floating and virtual IPs are much harder to offer.<\/p>\r\n<p>We will tell the&nbsp;story of OpenStack Networking at CERN. First integration with Nova Network, the migration to Neutron and how we're&nbsp;adding SDN&nbsp;in our infrastructure.<\/p>",

Adobe’s high-volume real-time bidding application operates today on an OpenStack private cloud with over 100,000 compute cores in six data centers in the US, Europe and Asia. Although this is one of the largest OpenStack deployments in the world, it is managed by only four Site Reliability Engineers as part of Adobe Advertising Cloud Multi-Cloud Infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Adobe Advertising Cloud’s DSP, formerly TubeMogul, was launched on the public cloud and hosted on AWS as of 2008, but in 2015 the team shifted to a Multi-Cloud Infrastructure and to its own OpenStack-driven data centers to achieve better performance. The move improved raw compute speed by 3X.<\/p>\n<p>In this session, veteran TechCrunch journalist Frederic Lardinois and Adobe Advertising Cloud Platform Manager Joseph Sandoval will chat about recent developments with Adobe Advertising Cloud, including: <br />Progress made with automation of operational services <br />Cloud bursting of some workloads back to the public cloud <br />How Kubernetes plays into the current and future cloud strategy <br />How the team is exploiting skip-level upgrades <br />New perspectives on coexisting as both a datacenter and a public cloud in the long term <br />Other challenges and lessons learned<\/p>\n<p>This session format was a big hit in Sydney, so join us if you want to hear the latest on how a member of the 100k Core Club is growing and succeeding in a multicloud world with OpenStack.<\/p>",

Providing an OCI and CRI compatible runtime, it is seamlessly integrated with OpenStack containers services. Each container, or each sandbox as defined by Zun, is hypervisor-isolated and runs inside a dedicated Linux VM. Combining Zun and Kata Containers provide OpenStack users with a much stronger isolation layer between all containerized workloads, while being able to safely run bare metal containers.<\/font><\/font><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font style=\"font-size: 11pt;\" size=\"2\">This talk will walk through Kata&rsquo;s unique architecture, how it integrates with Openstack and other Cloud software stacks, and focus around a few key points like networking and storage. It will highlight the will for Kata Containers to become a new standard to run virtualized containers, and encourage people to contribute.

In the case of policy decision point, OpenStack leverages keystone and oslo.policy, while Kubernetes provides mechanism to use external policy engine.<\/p>\n<p>This talk proposes a proof of concept to leverage a single external policy decision point (PDP) engine that would centralize PDP for both OpenStack and Kubernetes.

To resolve this problem, we introduced DPDK as microservices to ZTE's container network. We used some features of dpdk such as primary/secondary mode, lockless ring, sharing memory, virtio_user, vhost and so on, to promote the performance. At the same time, we used a heartbeat-like mechanism to keep alive and a fail-safe mechanism to provide high availability. Our model achieved bidirectional zero-copy between containers which brought us high performance at a cost of only one dedicated thread. This model could be used in 5G network slicing and other ICT areas.<\/p>",

L3 flavors enables the cloud to serve multiple backends in a single deployment. This serves many use cases where users want to have special mapping for underlay and overlay networks and they can have router of multiple choices. Each backend that serves virtual routing and forwarding needs to implement a L3 flavor drivers using neutron L3 flavor framework.

Microsoft is clearly fully focusing on Azure, leaving the large IaaS private cloud market open for third parties to fill in when it comes to Windows. Azure Stack does not fill that role: it is instead meant to bring Azure features on premise.<\/p>\r\n<p>OpenStack on the other side is a leader in the IaaS on-prem space with Cloudbase and the rest of the community making sure that Windows is a first class citizen in any OpenStack deployment. This journey starts with Cloudbase-Init and all the ways that you can take advantage of guest provisioning in Nova and Ironic for Windows, from the basics to more complex scenarios.<\/p>\r\n<p>The story doesn't stop with VMs or bare metal servers: Windows Servers Containers support reached beta stage in Kubernetes 1.9 thanks to a lot of cross-community work. We will talk about the future community plans and run a live demo of Windows Server Containers in Kubernetes on OpenStack!<\/p>",

Usage of DevOps requires the automatic management of software components on live systems and the possibility to send feedback from the live systems to the developers. ETSI NFV defined a multi layer MANO framework to manage the different layers of telecom services. OpenStack, as the defacto standard VIM, is a key enabler of DevOps in the NFV architecture, because of its capability to dynamically manage workloads. Currently there is an activity within the NFV community to introduce capabilities that allow DevOps and CI/CD concepts to fit into this framework.

To take advantage of the mobile/edge network possibilities, and enable the required flexibility to instantiation services on the fly anywhere on the network (core, aggregation or edge) we proposed to use both OpenStack and Kubernetes at VIM level, with Kuryr as the glue enabling both deployment models. As we integrate several network layers and orchestrators we have had to integrate several network layers: Neutron, Kubernetes, Kuryr and orchestrators (ManageIQ, OSM, Tacker...).

At least that would be the case in an ideal world. In our world, the key does not always turn. And if it does, the (Heat) engine driving Magnum may sputter and die. In the first part, we will closely examine the idealized life cycle of a Magnum cluster, from the initial REST call to the point where the user retrieves the access credentials for the finished cluster. We will follow the cluster through Magnum and the OpenStack components involved in building it as it takes shape and examine the roles the individual services play in creating the cluster bit by bit. In the second part we will provide troubleshooting advice on various parts of the cluster creation process that commonly fail. This part will cover both Magnum and Kubernetes related trouble.<\/span><\/p>",

Lee, NIST/IEEE Joint Working Group on Federated Cloud, lee@aero.org<br /> Dr. Martial Michel, Data Machines, Inc., martialmichel@datamachines.io<br /> Dr. Khalil Yazdi, Yazdi and Associates<br /> Dr. Robert Bohn, National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br /><strong>Purpose<\/strong><br /> Determine how the OpenStack Community can partner with the NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud, and the Open Research Cloud Alliance (ORCA), to develop support for general cloud federation, and enable a wide range of collaborative application domains at any level in the software stack: IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.<br /><br /><strong>Background<\/strong><br /> The momentum around cloud federation continues to grow. The NIST/IEEE Joint WG on Federated Cloud [1,2,3] has been running for almost seven months now, and recently held their first workshop [4] to report-out on current work and invite stakeholders to review, comment, help in charting the course of future work. The Open Research Cloud Alliance [5] has been actively developing consensus across the scientific community stakeholders and will be holding their 4th Open Research Cloud Congress at the Vancouver Summit. The Open Geospatial Consortium will also be kicking-off their Testbed-14 [6] project in April which has a federated cloud task to demonstrate specific geospatial data sharing scenarios.<br /><br /> This Forum topic will continue the discussion around cloud federation started at the OpenStack Summit Forum in Sydney [7,8]. Keystone, OpenStack and the OpenStack community are in a unique position to take a leadership position and make significant contributions to this process. Keystone has already built-out basic support to \"federate-in\" identities and \"federate-out\" OpenStack services. With modest additional capabilities Keystone could support general federations across multiple administrative domains [9] at any level in the system stack, i.e., IaaS, Paas, and SaaS. This would facilitate a wide variety of collaborations, including areas as diverse as international \"big science\" collaborations, international disaster response, and supply chain management, just to name a few.<br /><br /> This discussion session will center around possible federation deployment and governance models that could be built-out in Keystone that embody the key concepts and design principles being developed in the NIST/IEEE Joint WG and ORCA. The success of these efforts will depend directly on engaging with cloud builders, operators, and stakeholders. We welcome the opportunity to pursue this goal with the OpenStack community.<\/p>\n<p>[1] Press Release: <a href=\"http://standards.ieee.org/news/2017/intercloud_interoperability_and_federation.html\">http://standards.ieee.org/news/2017/intercloud_interoperability_and_federation.html<\/a><br />[2] NIST Public WG on Federated Cloud:<br />Twiki Page: <a href=\"http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/FederatedCloudPWGFC\">http://collaborate.nist.gov/twiki-cloud-computing/bin/view/CloudComputing/FederatedCloudPWGFC<\/a><br />Mailing List: fedcloud@nist.gov<br />[3] IEEE/P2302 Intercloud WG:<br /> Project Site: <a href=\"http://sites.ieee.org/sagroups-2302/\">http://sites.ieee.org/sagroups-2302/<\/a><br /> Mailing List: STDS-P2302@ieee.org<br /> [4] NIST/IEEE Federation Cloud Workshop, <a href=\"http://federatedcloud.eventbrite.com\">http://federatedcloud.eventbrite.com <\/a><br /> [5] <a href=\"http://www.openresearchcloud.org\">http://www.openresearchcloud.org<\/a><br /> [6] OGC Testbed-14, <a href=\"http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed14\">http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/testbed14 <\/a><br /> [7] <a href=\"https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Supporting-General-Federation\">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Supporting-General-Federation <\/a><br /> [8] <a href=\"http://www.openstack.org/summit/sydney-2017/summit-schedule/events/20534/3rd-open-research-cloudcongress\">https://www.openstack.org/summit/sydney-2017/summit-schedule/events/20534/3rd-open-research-cloudcongress<\/a><br /> [9] Lee, C.

Historically Horizon has been used more for configuration of virtualized resources and service, and not as much for real-time monitoring. However with new services such as Vitrage and Masakari which are introducing fault monitoring, root cause analysis and real-time recovery, there is a requirement for introducing constructs within Horizon to support such operational type functions.<br /><br />The new Extensible Headers feature in Horizon provides a re-usable mechanism for OpenStack Components to display content in an 'always-visible' header on the Horizon display. This session will describe the new feature and demo its use by Vitrage Alarm Banner. The underlying technologies and new Angular tool set will be discussed.  We will also demo the new capabilites introduced in Queen's.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p>NFV deployment is a multi-layered stack where a unified Orchestrator such as ONAP takes the responsibility of closed-loop automation for the resilience of virtual network function (VNF). The closed-loop should be event driven for both efficiency and accuracy. The closed-loop is triggered by some symptom usually coming from given alert or event.  Once triggered, a predefined policy is used to connect the symptom with proper recover operations which is a status machine relying on events too. So, the design of event driven framework becomes the key of closed loop. VNFs are often deployed and running on OpenStack for its rich resource management functions and API. To transfer the events from OpenStack to ONAP, we need to weave together various message bus systems and event sources. In this presentation, we will share an innovated framework which federates the events/alerts/metrics across different layers and sources with a demo of closed-loop automation through typical NFV use cases.<\/p>",

We will also be outlining best practices and design principles to follow when attempting to build your own CI/CD pipelines for OpenStack. Attendees will also learn about the challenges we faced with building our deployment infrastructure and how those challenges influenced our decisions and the design of our new system.

In such context OpenStack's control plane can be spread<br />over many different locations. As a consequence its internal management traffic<br />can go through a Wide Area Network made of heterogeneous and possible<br />unreliable network links.<\/p>\n<p>The session is about a study made under the umbrella of the FEMDC and<br />performance team and targets a deep evaluation of the communication<br />layer of OpenStack in massively distributed environments. This includes an<br />evaluation of different messaging technologies (broker and brokerless<br />approaches) while distributing ten thousands of agents over several<br />(micro-)datacenters. The presentation also focuses on the messaging patterns<br />offered by Oslo.Messaging and the methodology used.

			"description": "<p>As Providers strive to a cloud-native world, they keep their feet in the VM world by using hybrid solutions. In our presentation, we show an example of a VNF implementation based on VMs and containers. Various solutions have been proposed for this challenge. Some solutions use Magnum, Kuryr, Fuxi, or Zun to solve management and networking issues, but create strong linkage to OS. Others manage containers at VM level, so OS commands can be used, not K8S commands. Fully isolated environments could use one OS platform for cloud native, container only platforms and another for VMs, connecting them by a VNF with both containers and VMs, or with an SDN controller for the networking part. Our option allows VNFs to be developed for hybrid environments, where installation is based on OS and networking uses Calico BGP to distribute Neutron networks to container domain.We address lifecycle management, including installation, management, networking and root cause analysis in the hybrid world.  <\/p>",

			"description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">Since 2012, CERN is running an OpenStack cloud with currently around 300k cores to provide compute resources to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful proton accelerator in the world. To complete the service's offering by provisioning bare metal nodes in addition to virtual machines and containers, we recently started to integrate Ironic into our service deployment.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">In this presentation we will go through the integration process as well as the challenges arising from running the bare metal service in an environment managed by multiple teams responsible for different parts of and workflows in the datacenter.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">We will also show the benefits of moving everything under a unified OpenStack umbrella from both, the user's as well as the operators' perspective. While provisioning newly arrived hardware and giving access to \"exotic\" configurations was the primary task, we will also describe our efforts to transparently migrate already deployed servers into this new service.<\/span><\/p>",

Lot of interesting features have also been added to OpenStack in the past couple of years to target NFV use cases. Certainly, many customers have successfully executed several proof of concept deployments and several of them have even got some virtual network functions running in a production OpenStack environment. But are we truly ready for large scale production grade Telco deployment? Particularly, those covering use cases like Multi-Access Edge (MEC), 5G, SD-WAN etc. with secure multi-tenancy capability and robust FCAPS and Service Assurance? In this talk, we will provide an analysis of Operator requirements for 5G Networks and highlight the gaps/features in OpenStack that are required to make it Telco ready for a large scale 5G deployment.<\/p>",

Most of the components required for implementing such an architecture already exist as OpenStack projects; however there is not yet a clear strategy within the community for how these should all tie together.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To address this, a new Self-Healing SIG (Special Interest Group) was recently officially formed, which aims to coordinate the use and development of relevant OpenStack projects towards this vision.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In this talk, we present an introductory overview of the SIG's goals and recent and future work. We also discuss how the capabilities of existing projects can contribute to a coherent self-healing infrastructure, and explain how anyone interested can join in the efforts to drive this vision forward.<\/p>\n<\/div>",

			"description": "<p>OpenStack for Telco NFV Cloud deployment is rapidly gaining momentum, however Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) are pushing the limits on the network and demanding a feature rich high performance datapath. The OpenStack, Open vSwitch and Linux communities have upstreamed open APIs for SmartNICs, enabling high-throughput low-latency datapath with minimal performance tuning and the ability to manipulate inner packet headers providing services like firewall DDoS protection, Quality of Service (QoS) marking and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). These upstream integrated changes are emerging in stable open source distros with no custom patches and no vendor lock-in, supported by multiple SmartNIC vendors and SDN controllers. This is opening new flow processing possibilities, while freeing up expensive CPU resources for running application workloads. In this session, we demonstrate out-of-the-box fast data path functional progress and performance results achieved with OpenStack SmartNICs running VNF workloads at 10/25/50/100G, comparing vanilla OVS, OVS over DPDK and Full OVS offloads. Notably, our results run Nuage Networks Virtualized Cloud Services (SDN) on vanilla distros without kernel modifications or driver patches.<\/p>",

China Mobile features its future network with multiple DC specifically designed for telco scenarios called TIC (Telecom Integrated Cloud) across the whole countries. Edge TICs are small scale CO located in cities and counties, even base stations. We can hardly call them as DC or clouds.

Service owners can very efficiently manage multiple instances of their service, without having to deal with multiple copies of YAMLs and lower-level component configuration.<\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<div>Aptomi also provides provides visibility for application owners, allowing to visualize dependencies and impact of changes. When you have hundreds and thousands of containers running on k8s, it may be difficult to understand which applications they belong to, who owns them, why they were created, what is no longer in use, and the impact of changes. Aptomi solves that problem with its UI for contextualized visibility.<\/div>",

By having this, the application is able to keep zero downtime with its service during the operations as well as to be able to utilize new capabilities of the upgraded underlying compute nodes. Not only the application benefits from this, but also the infrastructure admin, as he can even request to down scale the application. That is, for rolling upgrades in networking systems where there may not be sufficient resources to perform rolling upgrade, e.g. due to strict Return on Investment (ROI) policy for the special Telco hardware used. Using the proposed framework, you can first down scale the application to free capacity on your hardware for then triggering the rolling upgrade. Presentation shows how this and much more will be accomplished.<\/p>",

Applications can be accelerated by increased responsiveness and maximized interactivity from the edge. Real-time analytics can be performed at the point of capture and corrective actions, can be taken locally.<br /><br />The ETSI MEC group has specified the architecture, interfaces and APIs for a distributed application platform. The MEC specifications aim to stimulate innovation and promote interoperability and deployment.

Having these networks understand and talk to each other while eliminating gateways will reduce network infrastructure footprint in edge sites.<\/p>\r\n<p>We will discuss common issues and how utilizing the Neutron's BGP-VPN API lets us address this and, in the process, make your edge cloud network be an extension of a wider VPN without any special overlays or network stitching. Additionally, it can request and receive guarantees in terms of bandwidth or latency as needed. All these are achieved not with investments in extra network equipment, but by merging the traditional CE/PE roles and providing higher port utilization and high throughput. Finally, we will also discuss how BGPVPN API's need to adapted for emerging network paradigms like Segment Routing etc.<\/p>",

This discussion, however, would focus on gathering a base set of requirements needed to be a contributing member of the community. After gathering this base set of requirements and crafting it into a formal document, we could then present it to the Board of Directors to have it added to onboarding documents for new OpenStack Foundation sponsors, and have it added to the openstack.org site for easy reference for organisations interested in joining our community. <br /><br /> [1] <a href=\"https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Contributing_Organization_Guide\">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/Contributing_Organization_Guide<\/a><\/span><\/p>",

			"description": "<p>Tencent has started using OpenStack since 2012. We develop and maintain our own cloud management system TStack based on OpenStack. This presentation shows TStack’s new roadmap including 3 objectives: usability, openness and flexibility. For usability, TStack has been refactored by micro-service architecture to enable CI/CD. OpenStack has already enables its Kubernetes deployment with Helm and Kolla. As a cloud management system, TStack has also been refactored into containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes. We firstly share our feedbacks about this refactoring. OpenStack is considered as an ecosystem to integrate upper PaaS and SaaS to improve openness. IaaS is considered as a base for the whole cloud ecosystem. Tencent has developed a rich portfolio of PaaS and SaaS. Thanks to the reference architecture and standard interfaces of OpenStack, we can easily integrate PaaS and SaaS based on OpenStack. Horizontally, flexibility is achieved by combining both Tencent public cloud and TStack private cloud resources in a hybrid mode. With the modern usage of cloud, e.g. edge computing, the frontier between the public cloud and private cloud becomes dynamic, an application can be easily migrate from a private cloud to a public cloud or vice versa. Tencent also builds such a dynamic hybrid cloud solution based on its public and private cloud.<\/p>",

If the community doesn't need or use these documents, maybe they should simply be deleted.<br /><br /> In this session we will briefly review the already completed conversion of the Operators Guide, and then discuss whether the OpenStack HA Guide and the OpenStack Architecture Guide should also be converted. This is a follow-on to a similar discussion we had during the Tokyo Ops Meetup but with a wider audience.<br /><br /> The aim is to either form a plan to maintain some of these documents and/or remove those that have reached end of life.<\/p>",

Telco providers have to meet service availability at 99.999% (Carrier-grade). Most of the VNFs are packaged and run on virtual machines. However containers with Kubernetes as orchestration engine is becoming more popular because of increased agility, reduced footprint and auto-scaling capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Though containers has become a viable alternative to virtual machines, there are significant gaps to meet carrier grade requirements for network functions in containers.

A key piece of this task was running five database migrations across three components (Nova, Glance, and Keystone), which took about an hour. Related work leading up to this migration was the re-imaging of almost 1,000 HVs to upgrade the OS and Libvirt, and also migrating our custom patches and plugins to work with the Ocata code base. During this entire process, any given VM was only down for a few hours during the HV upgrade, while the Nova API had even less downtime. We are currently expanding on this work for the Juno to Ocata upgrade of Ironic and Neutron in our Bare<\/span> <span style=\"font-size: 11pt; color: #000000; font-weight: 400;\">Metal clusters and will publish details on this at a later date.<\/span><\/p>",

How? Our community should address these questions.<\/p>\n<p><br />Before proposing new pieces of software, it is essential to conduct a gap analysis of the current code base. This talk presents the study carried within the FEMDC SiG.<\/p>\n<p>First, we introduce capabilities admins/users may expect - from the simplest, start a VM at a specific location; to the most advanced, interoperability across cloud stacks. Second, we discuss how we evaluated the different deployment scenarios that might be envisioned with the current OpenStack code base. We conclude by presenting the premise of a possible architecture leveraging OpenStack with the goal of initiating the debate with the community.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p>Beyond OpenStack for IT, NFV is another killer use case. Horizontally, multiple NGPoPs (OpenStack deployments) are geographically distributed but should be centrally controlled. Vertically, users of cross-layer services like bare-metal, IaaS, VNF and/or SDN should be federated. Hence, Identity and Access Management (IAM) module becomes a key issue.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed solution enables dynamic policy reconfiguration instead of static OSLO policy.json and enables external PDP to manage multiple OpenStack deployments for NFV NGPoPs. The organization of this PDP contains a set of upstreamed hooks to OpenStack/OSLO, OpenDaylight/AAA, and possibly OpenContrail in the future. It also proposed a reference implementation of the security engine policy called Moon hosted by the OPNFV community.<\/p>\n<p>Orange as major Telco operator is planning the deployment in production of this “external PDP mechanism” in 2019 for its first VNFs, in collaboration with the upstream community and Red Hat.<\/p>",

Instead of using one OpenStack to manage multiple data centers, NFV requires an independent security module to coordinate multiple OpenStack instances which are geographically distributed. The synchronization of user accounts and permissions among this OpenStack instances becomes a technical challenge. The proposition shows an “external PDP” approach as the “authorizations source of Truth” for the individual OpenStack deployments. The proposed policy engine also enables the dynamic reconfiguration of security policy. This drastically facilitates the administration of OpenStack by allowing adapting user permissions at runtime to satisfy ever changing business needs.<\/p>",

What are the roadmap priorities with respect to security? <br />• Vulnerabilities on the horizon: where should we place our priorities as a community of developers? <br />• What priorities should users have for hardening their security: the application level (user workloads) or the organization level (formal agreements with cloud users to address cloud privacy, security, and reliability)? <br />• What role, if any, do GDPR and other regulatory influences play in OpenStack security considerations?<\/p>\n<p>If you follow Sean, you know he asks tough, focused and fair questions.

			"description": "<p>While NFV and SDN integrated clouds are growing from centralized to geographically scattered and massively disctributed clouds, there by opening doors for IoT and Smart Infrastructures. Orchestration, Management and Maintenance has become more challenging and requires more attention to  accelerated service velocity. Automation is a prime solution to maintain complete environment. With a mix of smart hardware like smarnic, Machine Learning with appropriate active  resource and service invetory,  its possible to target dynamic  cloud management, allowing operating an Hands Free NFV. Here the focus will be on Infrastructure Management as we move from manul to infrastructure and on to service automation. The challenges we face are innumerous and will share what we have experienced dealing with compute (Redfish), storage(swordfish) and Networking (SDN-WAN) and how we add closed loops and benifit derived form Data Callection and Analysis with ML.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>",

Machine learning to analyse and act on supporting feedback loop gives the ability to do hands free NFV configuration, automation and operation management.  Service Providers, Operators and ICT Professionals working in Data Centers always like to try hands Free  NFV deployments and management. We will share with you what tried and learned from our attempts. <\/p>\n<p>The ML will need to internact for Data Collection with Celometer or Telemetry along with Nova, Neutron, Ceph, OpenVswitch, Ironic, SAI, Redfish, Swordfish and other evolving standards to build a model for data points and matrics to help automate and hence expect to learn and provide inputs to these modules in Openstack and thus Developers for this community can partipcate in this to build a better outcome.<\/p>",

The massively distributed clouds that result will be complex and there are many implementation decisions to make.<\/p>\n<p>The scale of 5G network, the distribution of the control function, reemphasize not just the need for automation but also the benefits of AI and predictive analytics. <\/p>\n<p>Automation will be built in multiple systems that have complementary but sometime overlapping scope. Openstack is one of them. The variety of architectures result in a variety of options.<\/p>\n<p>Autoscaling is a good example of such automation. Some of this logic will be built into the application layer possibly by a specialized microservice. But some of it can be built at the network layer in some Master orchestrator such as ONAP. Still some may also be built at the node level, in the Virtual infrastructure manager or in Openstack. <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>\n<p> <\/p>",

The preference was clear for Telco and NFV Vendors and now the same is reflected in Edge Computing. What is there and what is not has baffled even the ardent followers of Edge Computing. The pace of change has made use case selections for the Edge Computing a work in progress.

However, AI/HPC applications require high computational throughput where generic cloud resources would not suffice. There is a strong demand for OpenStack to support hardware accelerated devices in a dynamic model.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;\">In this session, we will introduce OpenStack Acceleration Service &ndash; Cyborg, which provides a management framework for accelerator devices (e.g. FPGA, GPU, NVMe SSD). We will also discuss Rack Scale Design (RSD) technology and explain how physical hardware resources can be dynamically aggregated to meet the AI/HPC requirements. The ability to &ldquo;compose on the fly&rdquo; with workload-optimized hardware and accelerator devices through an API allow data center managers to manage these resources in an efficient automated manner.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt;\">We will also introduce an enhanced telemetry solution with Gnnochi, bandwidth discovery and smart scheduling, by leveraging RSD technology, for efficient workloads management in HPC/AI cloud.<\/p>",

Leveraging Ceph RGW flexibility, users can have multiple clusters running different workloads concurrently with single back-end storage, making it suitable for big data analytics. Big data query engines Hadoop Hive and Presto is applied to represent user scenario. A comparable performance result is observed between disaggregated and hyper-converged architecture, providing users an option to ensure cluster flexibility as well as optimal performance. Tests to evaluate NVMe performance is also conducted. By comparing all-flash disks to spinning drives, improvements in performance and resource utilization are observed.<\/p>\n<p>In this session, we will share performance analysis of disaggregated architecture with all-flash Ceph. You will learn how parameters tuning affect performance and a suggested practice to configure Ceph for big data.<\/p>\n<p> <\/p>",

Today Role Based Access Control rules are fixed before deployment on an OpenStack instance into a datacenter. Any changes to these roles, is a very manual and tedious process that causes consistency issues across 100s of deployment and ends up in creating a snow flake deployment environment. Since granular roles are not available, users are tend to be given privileged roles. Higher privilege access causes a lot of issues including inadvertent deletes, access to  tenant data, and other security issues. With Dynamic RBAC, it provides the flexibility for Cloud Administrators to define stringent RBAC rules in real time and apply/activate these roles immediately eliminating the need to the next deployment cycle and tightening any security loop holes.<\/p>",

			"description": "<p>As the Verizon Wireless OpenStack Edge platform grows, making efficient use of resources also grows in importance, to deliver the cost benefits of OpenStack to Verizon customers. This presentation explores how utilization at the highest level, Virtual Network Function (VNF) redundancy pairs, relates to utilizations at intermediate and lower levels. For example, an intermediate level, a nova server, corresponds to a lower level Libvirt instance, which in turn is composed of CPU cores which each have utilizations. In some cases, these CPU cores may be pinned by the VNF design, and used at 100%, in which case no optimization is possible. In other cases, some over-subscription may be possible without impacting services. In addition to tying a given nova VM together with its foundational levels, each VNF frequently contains multiple nova instances, neutron networks, and cinder volumes, which also must be considered when over-subscribing.<\/p>",

This tying together has benefits both for efficiency, via over-subscription, and reliability, via rapid fault isolation. For a given VNF, many OpenStack services are involved, typically including nova instances, neutron networks, cinder volumes, and more. Each of these services is then supported by underlying layers; in the case of nova, KVM and CPU cores, which are in turn supported by computes, which are in turn correlated with hardware data. As some CPU cores are often pinned in VNFs, and may be utilized at 100%, over-subscription is not always possible. The VNF site-redundant pair is also monitored at a high level to ensure that any over-subscription will not adversely impact key functionality.<\/p>",

This led to the launch of&nbsp;OpenStack in July 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">After launching OpenStack, my focus shifted full time to community building activitites to grow OpenStack, as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for OpenStack. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The ecosystem and the brand have grown in concert, as new organizations that we've attracted have helped spread the word and improve the OpenStack software by hiring dozens of OpenStack developers,&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;solutions that meet the needs of users such as Cisco Webex, eBay, Mercado Libre, and Paypal.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2011, I began the work of establishing the independent OpenStack Foundation, along with Jonathan Bryce (now Executive Director) and many others&nbsp;throughout the community. &nbsp;This open process included writing and revising the basic structure,&nbsp;principles, and ultimately the bylaws in an open manner, until we launched the new independent foundation in the Fall of 2012. &nbsp;The&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;of a User Committee is one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most vital components of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new structure, IMHO, as in the end the software is for the users, and that is who we must fight for.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm now the Chief Operating Officer of the OpenStack Foundation, and work full time to achieve the OpenStack Foundation Mission focused on \"<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>Protecting<\/em><\/strong><em>,<\/em><strong><em>&nbsp;Empowering<\/em><\/strong><em>, and&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>Promoting&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em>OpenStack software and the community around it, including users, developers and the entire ecosystem.\"<\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside of OpenStack, I&nbsp;love music, Austin, BBQ, wakeboarding on Lake Austin, and basketball (Rockets &amp; Longhorns fan). I&nbsp;sometimes make angel investments but I mostly juggle working on OpenStack and spending time with my family. I usually go by \"sparkycollier\" on the interwebs, which is my way of honoring my late, great, Great Dane Sparky.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">More Links:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/markcollier\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/markcollier<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http://markcollier.me/\">http://markcollier.me/<\/a><\/span><\/p>",
