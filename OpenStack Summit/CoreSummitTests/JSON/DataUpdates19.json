In 2013, he began working with containers as well and ultimately implemented containerized Docker Ceph services. Now on a daily basis, he rotates between Ceph, OpenStack, and Docker in an effort to strengthen the integration between all three. From time to time, he also attends various summits and events where he evangelizes these technologies and their usage, while devoting his copious spare time to blogging.

This led to the launch of&nbsp;OpenStack in July 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">After launching OpenStack, my focus shifted full time to community building activitites to grow OpenStack, as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for OpenStack. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The ecosystem and the brand have grown in concert, as new organizations that we've attracted have helped spread the word and improve the OpenStack software by hiring dozens of OpenStack developers,&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;solutions that meet the needs of users such as Cisco Webex, eBay, Mercado Libre, and Paypal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2011, I began the work of establishing the independent OpenStack Foundation, along with Jonathan Bryce (now Executive Director) and many others&nbsp;throughout the community. &nbsp;This open process included writing and revising the basic structure,&nbsp;principles, and ultimately the bylaws in an open manner, until we launched the new independent foundation in the Fall of 2012. &nbsp;The&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;of a User Committee is one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most vital components of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new structure, IMHO, as in the end the software is for the users, and that is who we must fight for.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm now the Chief Operating Officer of the OpenStack Foundation, and work full time to achieve the OpenStack Foundation Mission focused on \"</span><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>Protecting</em></strong><em>,</em><strong><em>&nbsp;Empowering</em></strong><em>, and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Promoting&nbsp;</em></strong><em>OpenStack software and the community around it, including users, developers and the entire ecosystem.\"</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside of OpenStack, I&nbsp;love music, Austin, BBQ, wakeboarding on Lake Austin, and basketball (Rockets &amp; Longhorns fan). I&nbsp;sometimes make angel investments but I mostly juggle working on OpenStack and spending time with my family. I usually go by \"sparkycollier\" on the interwebs, which is my way of honoring my late, great, Great Dane Sparky.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">More Links:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/markcollier\">http://www.linkedin.com/in/markcollier</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http://markcollier.me/\">http://markcollier.me/</a></span></p>",

For the last 10+ years, I've chosen technology evangelism, partner enablement, and developer empowerment to be the focus of my career. &nbsp;Over the last 5+ years, I've traveled to 30+ countries visiting telco and enterprise partners and customers in EMEA, APAC, and Latin America to discuss ICT and Cloud initiatives, evangelized OpenStack&nbsp;to both enterprise and telco communities, and presented the latest Cloud/OpenStack technologies and business trends at various industry conferences and forums</p>\r\n<p>I formally joined the OpenStack community in July 2015 and I've been a regular speaker for the last 3 summits (Tokyo, Austin, and Barcelona). I have conducted one sponsored keynote, several session presentations, and hosted various panels in the area of telco trends, containers, and community. In 2016, I served as an OpenStack Board Director, participated in various OpenStack work groups, helped organize the 1st OpenStack Days: China event with 3500+ registrants, 2400+ attendees and multiple hackathons/bug smash events in China. &nbsp;With my engineering and business background and training in Enterprise IT and Telco, I would like to continue contributing to the OpenStack community in the following areas:</p>\r\n<p>1. Generate mindshare and increase telco and service provider adoption in OpenStack</p>\r\n<p>2. Bring enterprise and telco customer requirements/perspectives to OpenStack community</p>\r\n<p>3. Enable the global developer and ISV communities to build interesting apps for OpenStack</p>\r\n<p>4. Help woman developers and engineers grow using OpenStack as a platform</p>\r\n<p>5. Help OpenStack embrace diversity and make OpenStack a true global movement&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>6. Foster more collaboration and partnerships among OpenStack members and various regional communities</p>",

But my attention always seems to return to close to the metal, large infrastructure. Starting out in EE as a systems engineer, I migrated to SW development then on to QA and SW Process. During the journey, I have analysed Space Shuttle launch communications, modelled complex space systems. I have tested compilers, debuggers and visualization tools for a SIMD system and done software bringup for a SPARC based, multiprocessor mainframe. I have managed teams supporting software release, compute farms for chip design, and QA and escalation for mobile embedded compute systems and location based apps on mobile phones. &nbsp;Ensuring all of these were successes is why I am a champion for operations, interoperability, quality, reliability and usability. &nbsp;They all go hand-in-hand in creating success.</p>\r\n<p>As for Open Source, I have been aware and peripherally involved in Open Source since the original creation of Copy Left, but am finally fully immersed in it now, as an OpenStack resource within OpenStack and Huawei. I have learned through my endeavors that my skillset is best applied once a certain level of maturity has been achieved in a project.
