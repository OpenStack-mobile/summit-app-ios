I am a really geeky dude that was forced to handle security and compliance so the only coding I do is on my spare time. Luckily that's also what I like to do in my spre time, work. But real work and not just a lot of complinace and regulations but something that is acctually for the betterment of mankind. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately I happen to bee good at security, especially social engineering, and now I am stuck. But I am happy to share my knowledge and experience in making thins both secure and compliant. And no they are not alwas the same thing. </p>\n<p>Compliance is solved through the cloud. Epecially smarter clouds. OpenStack is the key to this. OpenStack is 42 to compliance. One stack to forever in the darkness bind them.</p>\n<p> </p>",
