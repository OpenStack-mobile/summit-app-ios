The educational program requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the project&rsquo;s technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session, the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaining problems they might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px; color: #666a73; font-family: 'Benton Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full two-day training session.<\/span><\/p>","social_description":null,"start_date":1461510000,"end_date":1461531600,"location_id":42,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upstream-university-openstack-summit-austin-tickets-22669105906","track_id":41,"level":"Beginner","moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":null,"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"speakers":[63],"slides":[],"links":[],"videos":[]},{"id":6829,"title":"Command Presence Workshop, Organized by the Women of OpenStack","description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/commandpresenceworkshop.eventbrite.com\">RSVP Required<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Command Presence\u00a0Workshop<\/strong> has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.\u00a0 It is intended to teach participants how to handle \u201csenior-level high pressure meetings\u201d.\u00a0 The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event.\u00a0 In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides.\u00a0 Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins.\u00a0 There is a role-play simulation.

However, operating multiple small DCs breaks somehow the idea of mutualization in terms of resources and administration simplicity, making this approach questionable.<\/p>\r\n<p>One way to enhance mutualization is to leverage existing network centers, starting from the core nodes of the backbone to the numerous access points available worldwide.

The infrastructure supporting OpenStack cloud needs to be flexibly composed to run optimally for these workloads.<\/p>\n<p>In this session, we introduce Open Composable Network (OCN), a new way of cloud networking that stemmed from the hyper-scale cloud and web services giants, but is being made available widely by Mellanox and our cloud ecosystem partners. Similar to Lego design, which use basic components with standard interfaces to construct into anything you can imagine, OCN leverages network disaggregation (into basic network building blocks), open abstraction interfaces, and automated orchestration and management to turn these building blocks into networks optimally composed to support your unique workload. This new way of cloud networking enables open platforms to unlock performance and unleash innovation to achieve web-scale efficiency. Our end-to-end 25\/50\/100G Ethernet and InfiniBand intelligent interconnect solutions provide unparalleled speeds, predictable performance, and extreme flexibility to compose and recompose software-defined infrastructures to meet the needs of cloud-native and enterprise workloads. We&rsquo;ll discuss the OCN architecture and share with you real world deployments of our OpenStack customers such as Cambridge, Enter, and NCI to showcase how these public and private clouds have achieved unmatched OpenStack efficiency and flexibility.<\/p>","social_description":null,"start_date":1461623400,"end_date":1461625800,"location_id":63,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"track_id":45,"level":"Beginner","moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":null,"sponsors":[77],"tags":[],"speakers":[5768],"slides":[],"links":[],"videos":[{"id":21875,"name":"Mellanox - Open Composable Networks: Leverage Lego Design to Transform Cloud Networking","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":8924,"youtube_id":"qlO0DEeJfgs","data_uploaded":1461627789,"highlighted":false,"views":194}]},{"id":8937,"title":"Red Hat - Red Hat & Cisco - Providing Enterprise Choice with OpenStack","description":"<p>Whether you are a Service Provider or an Enterprise, Red Hat and Cisco have partnered to bring the industry's leading portfolio of OpenStack solutions.

Address scopes build from the subnet pools feature added in Kilo.  While subnet pools give us a mechanism for controlling the allocation of addresses to subnets, address scopes give Neutron a way to know where addresses are viable.  They are also the thing within which addresses are not allowed to overlap.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give a quick review of subnet pools and then talk about how they support address scopes.  Address scopes are key to overcoming the problem of \"bring your own addressing\" (BYOA) and are instrumental in determining where traffic should be blocked or where net address translation (NAT) should be applied (or not).  This is especially important when designing your cloud for IPv6.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will briefly discuss the relationship between address scopes and two other exciting new features in Neutron:  \"BGP dynamic routing\" and \"routed networks.\"","social_description":null,"start_date":1461852019,"end_date":1461854459,"location_id":52,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"track_id":24,"level":"Intermediate","moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":"When Neutron began, users were expected to specify the addresses to use when they create subnets.

It made it impossible to know where addresses are viable.\r\n\r\nThe first limitation was solved with the addition of subnet pools in Kilo.\r\n\r\nThe second limitation effectively led to the decision to NAT everything between tenant networks and the external network in Neutron routers. Think about it this way, the cloud operator has no way of knowing where the addresses on the tenant networks came from, so the only valid assumption to make is that they\u2019re all private addresses and are not viable anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing demand to be able to route tenant networks on the external network.  First, tenants have to disable NAT on their routers.  Second, operators have to trust that tenants are all using the right addresses.\r\n\r\nWith address scopes, you can set up the scopes for tenants to pull from. Then, since Neutron routers understand address scopes, they won\u2019t NAT between these networks and my external network as long as the scopes match. They\u2019ll just do straight routing.\r\n","attendees_expected_learnt":"Attendees will learn when and how to apply address scopes.

While attempting to install OpenStack with Networking (neutron) for the first time, I ran into significant hurdles from issues with the installation guide. After determining the source of the main problem, I filed my first documentation bug with a suggested patch. Several patches later, I realized that the networking chapter needed rewriting from the ground up. Working with several people on the documentation team, I completely rewrote the content for the Icehouse release and have continued to improve it along with other portions of the installation guide and other community documentation.<\/p>\r\n<p>I became very familiar with OpenStack during this journey, particularly the Networking service, and have assisted a large number of people with architecture, deployment, operation, and troubleshooting. You can almost always find me on IRC in the #openstack channel. Between support, bug triage, and general observations, the Networking component seems to cause the most frustration because most people learning OpenStack come from virtualization platforms with only basic networking features or from network infrastructures using physical equipment rather than Linux. The lack of practical documentation, arguably less than any other service, only increases frustration.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the Icehouse development cycle, people from various parts of the OpenStack community including myself from the core documentation team decided that we needed to develop a networking guide. Content development began during the Juno development cycle and continues today. Since the beginning of the networking guide project, I developed, tested, and contributed documentation for several practical scenarios for deploying the Networking service.<\/p>\r\n<p>I currently work for IBM as a software developer and contribute to several OpenStack projects including core documentation, Networking, and Open Virtual Network (OVN).<\/p>","irc":"Sam-I-Am","twitter":"ionosphere80","presentations":[7751],"moderated_presentations":[],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4038","gender":"Male","member_id":14400},{"id":4503,"first_name":"Stig","last_name":"Telfer","title":"OpenStack HPC contributor, Cambridge University","bio":"<p>Stig's career includes research and development&nbsp;in HPC and SDN, and using both technologies in a&nbsp;cloud compute environment, starting with OpenStack Havana.<\/p>\r\n<p>Stig works as a freelance OpenStack HPC consultant with Cambridge University's Research Computing Services group.<\/p>","irc":"oneswig","twitter":"oneswig","presentations":[7755],"moderated_presentations":[],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4503","gender":"Male","member_id":17790},{"id":4505,"first_name":"John","last_name":"Taylor","title":"High Performance Computing Service, Cambridge Univ","bio":"<p>John works with Cambridge University on flagship scientific compute programmes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)<\/p>","irc":null,"twitter":null,"presentations":[7755],"moderated_presentations":[],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4505"},{"id":2905,"first_name":"Dr. Paul","last_name":"Calleja","title":"Head of Research Computing Services, Cambridge Uni","bio":"<p><span>Dr Paul Calleja, Director HPC Cambridge Paul has over 20 years experience in HPC starting as an HPC user developing and using HPC molecular modelling codes, then as an HPC vendor designing and implementing over 200 commercial HPC systems.
