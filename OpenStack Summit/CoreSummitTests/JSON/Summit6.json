The educational program requires students to work on real-life bug fixes or new features during two days of real-life classes and online mentoring, until the work is accepted by OpenStack. The live two-day class teaches them to navigate the intricacies of the project&rsquo;s technical tools and social interactions. In a followup session, the students benefit from individual online sessions to help them resolve any remaining problems they might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 10px 0px 0px; color: #666a73; font-family: 'Benton Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Roboto, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; letter-spacing: 0.5px; line-height: 22px;\"><span style=\"padding-top: 0px;\">Make sure to book your travel plans to arrive in Austin Friday evening or Saturday morning in order to attend the full two-day training session.<\/span><\/p>","start_date":1461510000,"end_date":1461531600,"location_id":42,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/upstream-university-openstack-summit-austin-tickets-22669105906","level":"Beginner","track_id":41,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[],"tags":[],"speakers":[63],"slides":[],"links":[],"videos":[]},{"id":6829,"title":"Command Presence Workshop, Organized by the Women of OpenStack","description":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/commandpresenceworkshop.eventbrite.com\">RSVP Required<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The <strong>Command Presence\u00a0Workshop<\/strong> has been recognized by the Anita Borg Institute and Harvard Business Review.\u00a0 It is intended to teach participants how to handle \u201csenior-level high pressure meetings\u201d.\u00a0 The majority of the workshop is a task-force convened to address a simulated, but very realistic crisis event.\u00a0 In the class, each participant assumes a role, and is given about 30minutes to prepare 1-2 slides.\u00a0 Once the class has prepared, the simulation begins.\u00a0 There is a role-play simulation.

More precisely, we describe how we extended Nova with an additional driver allowing the use of a distributed key\/value store instead of the centralized SQL backend.

However, operating multiple small DCs breaks somehow the idea of mutualization in terms of resources and administration simplicity, making this approach questionable.<\/p>\r\n<p>One way to enhance mutualization is to leverage existing network centers, starting from the core nodes of the backbone to the numerous access points available worldwide.

The infrastructure supporting OpenStack cloud needs to be flexibly composed to run optimally for these workloads.<\/p>\n<p>In this session, we introduce Open Composable Network (OCN), a new way of cloud networking that stemmed from the hyper-scale cloud and web services giants, but is being made available widely by Mellanox and our cloud ecosystem partners. Similar to Lego design, which use basic components with standard interfaces to construct into anything you can imagine, OCN leverages network disaggregation (into basic network building blocks), open abstraction interfaces, and automated orchestration and management to turn these building blocks into networks optimally composed to support your unique workload. This new way of cloud networking enables open platforms to unlock performance and unleash innovation to achieve web-scale efficiency. Our end-to-end 25\/50\/100G Ethernet and InfiniBand intelligent interconnect solutions provide unparalleled speeds, predictable performance, and extreme flexibility to compose and recompose software-defined infrastructures to meet the needs of cloud-native and enterprise workloads. We&rsquo;ll discuss the OCN architecture and share with you real world deployments of our OpenStack customers such as Cambridge, Enter, and NCI to showcase how these public and private clouds have achieved unmatched OpenStack efficiency and flexibility.<\/p>","start_date":1461623400,"end_date":1461625800,"location_id":63,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"level":"Beginner","track_id":45,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":null,"attendees_expected_learnt":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[77],"tags":[],"speakers":[5768],"slides":[],"links":[],"videos":[{"id":21875,"name":"Mellanox - Open Composable Networks: Leverage Lego Design to Transform Cloud Networking","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":8924,"youtube_id":"qlO0DEeJfgs","data_uploaded":1461627789,"highlighted":false,"views":182}]},{"id":8937,"title":"Red Hat - Red Hat & Cisco - Providing Enterprise Choice with OpenStack","description":"<p>Whether you are a Service Provider or an Enterprise, Red Hat and Cisco have partnered to bring the industry's leading portfolio of OpenStack solutions.

In the Mitaka release there was a xproject spec to deprecate all individual CLIs [1]. A few things are falling into place to make Newton a critical development cycle for the OSC team and other projects. i) In the Newton release the keystone team will no longer ship a CLI in keystoneclient [2], making OSC a common tool for operators; ii) Missing capabilities for networking and v2 volume support is quickly being added; iii) Several new projects have created or are creating OSC plugins [3], and the main issue of commands overlapping each other should be caught early by a gate job.\r<br \/>With that said, it's not all perfect. The cinder team has brought up some issues [4], namely the properties vs metadata naming convention. This issue, and other conventions the OSC has adopted that divert from the typical CLI usage should be addressed now rather than when it is too late. Additionally, the topic of \"when\" a team should switch \/ advertise \/ deprecate has been brought up many times, and likely needs consensus and a standardized plan.\r<br \/>With all that said, we're getting some nice feedback [5][6] :)\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Links:\r<br \/> 1. <a href=\"http:\/\/specs.openstack.org\/openstack\/openstack-specs\/specs\/deprecate-cli.html\">http:\/\/specs.openstack.org\/openstack\/openstack-specs\/specs\/deprecate-cli.html<\/a>\r<br \/> 2. <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/openstack\/python-keystoneclient\/commit\/ef13bd8cf6c6e46f4ce04fa3a21552913417b586\">https:\/\/github.com\/openstack\/python-keystoneclient\/commit\/ef13bd8cf6c6e46f4ce04fa3a21552913417b586<\/a> \r<br \/> 3. <a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/state-of-osc-plugins\">https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/state-of-osc-plugins<\/a>\r<br \/> 4. <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/090375.html\">http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/090375.html<\/a>\r<br \/> 5. <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/090641.html\">http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/090641.html<\/a>\r<br \/> 6. <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2015-October\/076112.html\">http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2015-October\/076112.html<\/a>","start_date":1461687300,"end_date":1461689700,"location_id":85,"summit_id":6,"type_id":8,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":3601,"tag":"Cross Project workshops"}]},{"id":9530,"title":"Design Summit 101","description":"\nIs this your first OpenStack Design Summit?

While consistency is a good goal, managing the list of *versions* of dependencies is a huge amount of work, especially around release time when we need to make sure all projects are synced up. There is also risk as we move ahead with the constraints system, because we don't have sufficient test coverage of constraints changes to know when those changes will break a project. As part of my push to remove self-imposed requirements that introduce more work than gain, I propose that we drop our requirement for co-installability of all services and let each project manage its own versions of dependendencies and constraints directly by relying on containers for deployment and\/or container-ish things like virtualenvs for our CI testing. However, I propose that we keep a list of packages allowed to be used, without specifying the versions, to maintain our consistency goal. Is this possible? What do we lose?

To implement these operations we use Ansible playbooks for a standardized set of reusable templates. We think it\u2019s powerful, and our HPE Helion customers like it too.

While many vendors have focused on the problems of VM Sprawl and the need for thousands of relatively small but high performance Cinder Volumes, very few have focused on the problems of storage for OpenStack applications that create and manage Petabytes of image, video and other large unstructured data objects. Today, a new generation of object storage systems provide the ability for applications in OpenStack environments to access storage over the fast growing AWS S3 interface.

On top of this, an advantage to apache\/nginx is that you can easily forward requests on different paths to different servers, so rather than using ports for each service we can have apache accept on port 80 (e.g., \/identity -> keystone-public, \/identity_admin -> keystone-admin, \/dashboard -> horizon, \/compute -> nova-api, etc.).\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Devstack also has a tls-proxy config option which is there to put stud in front of the eventlet servers (because of eventlet server's weak TLS support).

So, wouldn't it be great if the community could actually be proactive and plan how discovery should be formatted\/called\/interfaced to across all the projects before all the projects implement their discovery(s) differently?  And hey, maybe this raises the question of whether an Oslo lib can help with consistency, too.  I'd like to see the community get a converged set of requirements and design *before* each writes its divergent version.  It's not top of the list priority for development for this cycle, which is good.  A session now can get folks thinking about how to do this consistently and get specs in place this cycle, without having to prioritize code for this for Newton.\r<br \/>\r<br \/>References:\r<br \/> - <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/090927.html\">nova<\/a>\r<br \/> - <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/088895.html\">all, zaqar, cloudkitty<\/a>\r<br \/> - <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/087982.html\">neutron<\/a>\r<br \/> - <a href=\"http:\/\/lists.openstack.org\/pipermail\/openstack-dev\/2016-March\/088075.html\">the ask<\/a>","start_date":1461703200,"end_date":1461705600,"location_id":85,"summit_id":6,"type_id":8,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":3601,"tag":"Cross Project workshops"}]},{"id":7737,"title":"Guide to Simulation of Bare Metal servers for scale testing ","description":"<p><em><strong>Ironic<\/strong><\/em>, the OpenStack Bare Metal Provisioning Program is evolving fast with many new functionalities integrating with it.

The Swift developer community has recently been working on enhancing Swift&rsquo;s security by adding the capability to encrypt object content stored on disk. Our goal is to protect data at rest from an attacker that gains physical access to disks. We aim to achieve this with complete transparency to clients i.e. with no API changes, other than optional extensions to support client provided keys when desired.<\/p>\r\n<p>This talk will describe and demonstrate this exciting new feature, discuss options for integration with key management services such as Barbican, and look ahead at future work to additionally encrypt account and container metadata.<\/p>","start_date":1461765619,"end_date":1461768059,"location_id":59,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"level":"Intermediate","track_id":25,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":"<p>We&rsquo;re addressing the security of data at rest in Swift clusters. Users&rsquo; data is at risk of exposure should a third party gain access to a disk. Disks could be stolen, mistakenly disposed of before being scrubbed, or faulty and therefore unable to be scrubbed.<\/p>\r\n<p>Users can of course guard against this risk by encrypting data before sending to Swift, but often a server-side encryption service is desirable. This may be because operators themselves must ensure encryption of data at rest to satisfy regulatory and\/or customer requirements, or because clients do not wish to manage encryption keys.<\/p>\r\n<p>Our solution encrypts objects as they arrive at a Swift proxy. This has advantages over other server-side encryption approaches: encrypting content once in the proxy incurs lower CPU overhead than having each replica encrypted on object servers using existing block encryption tools such as dm-crypt; encrypting in Swift itself avoids the cost of upgrading hardware to self-encrypting disks.<\/p>","attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees will learn about the goals (and non-goals) of Swift encryption, hear about the progress being made towards encryption being enabled in upstream Swift, see a demonstration of object encryption and gain an understanding of the trade-offs with other encryption solutions.<\/p>","summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":3385,"tag":"Upstream"},{"id":3368,"tag":" Upstream Dev"},{"id":3351,"tag":" Women of OpenStack"},{"id":3384,"tag":" Barbican"},{"id":3364,"tag":" Swift"}],"speakers":[987,3741],"slides":[{"id":28091,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":6869,"link":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/assets\/presentation-media\/swift-encryption-austin-summit.pdf"}],"links":[{"id":301,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":6869,"link":"Swift spec at https:\/\/specs.openstack.org\/openstack\/swift-specs\/specs\/in_progress\/at_rest_encryption.html"},{"id":302,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":6869,"link":"Feature branch in Swift repo at https:\/\/github.com\/openstack\/swift\/tree\/feature\/crypto"}],"videos":[{"id":23507,"name":"Swift Object Encryption","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":6869,"youtube_id":"SBkvHYFhwjQ","data_uploaded":1461784654,"highlighted":false,"views":250}]},{"id":7513,"title":"Getting Started With OpenStack","description":"<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/handsonworkshops-openstacksummitaustin.eventbrite.com\/\">RSVP required<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>OpenStack continues to grow as the de facto standard for open source Cloud platforms and private clouds in general.

Now that we have a deprecation filter we can make use of that to notify deployers and take them through a deprecation cycle if we feel that's important. The aim is to simplify the roles and reduce technical debt. There is an overwhelming number of task tags assigned between all of the roles involved in OpenStack-Ansible. And in some cases, limiting to one particular tag may not have any substantial outcome. Look into consistency of tagging between roles and trimming down of existing tags.

We were given a mandate to develop an architecture capable of supporting AT&amp;T's application needs and then deploying it in 50+ locations. The catch is, these PoPs are very constrained in terms of space, network and power. Therefore, we need to run a very featureful cloud in a hardware poor environment. This required us to virtualize the entire control plane among other things. We also had to solve the sticky issue of having MaaS, Fuel and vCenter all wanting to do DHCP and PXE boot every single node on the VLAN (we couldn't use multiples).

Address scopes build from the subnet pools feature added in Kilo.  While subnet pools give us a mechanism for controlling the allocation of addresses to subnets, address scopes give Neutron a way to know where addresses are viable.  They are also the thing within which addresses are not allowed to overlap.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give a quick review of subnet pools and then talk about how they support address scopes.  Address scopes are key to overcoming the problem of \"bring your own addressing\" (BYOA) and are instrumental in determining where traffic should be blocked or where net address translation (NAT) should be applied (or not).  This is especially important when designing your cloud for IPv6.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will briefly discuss the relationship between address scopes and two other exciting new features in Neutron:  \"BGP dynamic routing\" and \"routed networks.\"","start_date":1461852019,"end_date":1461854459,"location_id":52,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":0,"is_published":true,"head_count":0,"rsvp_link":null,"level":"Intermediate","track_id":24,"moderator_speaker_id":0,"problem_addressed":"When Neutron began, users were expected to specify the addresses to use when they create subnets. I call this \u201cbring your own addressing\u201d or BYOA. This was not ideal for a couple of reasons.\r\n\r\n1. It put a burden on end users to manage their address usage.\r\n2. It made it impossible to know where addresses are viable.\r\n\r\nThe first limitation was solved with the addition of subnet pools in Kilo.\r\n\r\nThe second limitation effectively led to the decision to NAT everything between tenant networks and the external network in Neutron routers. Think about it this way, the cloud operator has no way of knowing where the addresses on the tenant networks came from, so the only valid assumption to make is that they\u2019re all private addresses and are not viable anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThere is increasing demand to be able to route tenant networks on the external network.  First, tenants have to disable NAT on their routers.  Second, operators have to trust that tenants are all using the right addresses.\r\n\r\nWith address scopes, you can set up the scopes for tenants to pull from. Then, since Neutron routers understand address scopes, they won\u2019t NAT between these networks and my external network as long as the scopes match. They\u2019ll just do straight routing.\r\n","attendees_expected_learnt":"Attendees will learn when and how to apply address scopes.

While attempting to install OpenStack with Networking (neutron) for the first time, I ran into significant hurdles from issues with the installation guide. After determining the source of the main problem, I filed my first documentation bug with a suggested patch. Several patches later, I realized that the networking chapter needed rewriting from the ground up. Working with several people on the documentation team, I completely rewrote the content for the Icehouse release and have continued to improve it along with other portions of the installation guide and other community documentation.<\/p>\r\n<p>I became very familiar with OpenStack during this journey, particularly the Networking service, and have assisted a large number of people with architecture, deployment, operation, and troubleshooting. You can almost always find me on IRC in the #openstack channel. Between support, bug triage, and general observations, the Networking component seems to cause the most frustration because most people learning OpenStack come from virtualization platforms with only basic networking features or from network infrastructures using physical equipment rather than Linux. The lack of practical documentation, arguably less than any other service, only increases frustration.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the Icehouse development cycle, people from various parts of the OpenStack community including myself from the core documentation team decided that we needed to develop a networking guide. Content development began during the Juno development cycle and continues today. Since the beginning of the networking guide project, I developed, tested, and contributed documentation for several practical scenarios for deploying the Networking service.<\/p>\r\n<p>I currently work for IBM as a software developer and contribute to several OpenStack projects including core documentation, Networking, and Open Virtual Network (OVN).<\/p>","irc":"Sam-I-Am","twitter":"ionosphere80","presentations":[7751],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4038","gender":"Male","member_id":14400},{"id":4503,"first_name":"Stig","last_name":"Telfer","title":"OpenStack HPC contributor, Cambridge University","bio":"<p>Stig's career includes research and development&nbsp;in HPC and SDN, and using both technologies in a&nbsp;cloud compute environment, starting with OpenStack Havana.<\/p>\r\n<p>Stig works as a freelance OpenStack HPC consultant with Cambridge University's Research Computing Services group.<\/p>","irc":"oneswig","twitter":"oneswig","presentations":[7755],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4503","gender":"Male","member_id":17790},{"id":4505,"first_name":"John","last_name":"Taylor","title":"High Performance Computing Service, Cambridge Univ","bio":"<p>John works with Cambridge University on flagship scientific compute programmes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)<\/p>","irc":null,"twitter":null,"presentations":[7755],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4505"},{"id":2905,"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Calleja","title":"Head of Research Computing Services, Cambridge Uni","bio":"<p>Paul Calleja is director of Research Computing Services at Cambridge University.<\/p>","irc":null,"twitter":null,"presentations":[7755,8518,9076],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/2905","gender":null,"member_id":39356},{"id":1941,"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Proulx","title":"Sr Technical Architect - MIT Computer Science and ","bio":"<p>Jonathan Proulx is the Sr Technical Architect at MIT\/CSAIL<br \/>(<a href=\"https:\/\/xmail.bu.edu\/owa\/redir.aspx?C=TAOYSyznlk2Oaw-e4-CjAK5ao1QtktIIVC91C8CGW285Tm8b6APo1idrxpzLupVR0ouFNWUHp9s.&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.csail.mit.edu\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.csail.mit.edu<\/a>) making sure the world class researchers<br \/>there have a world class infrastructure to support them.&nbsp; From<br \/>planning through proof of concept to production deployment and legacy<br \/>maintenance Jonathan has seen several generations of infrastructure<br \/>through the lab.

Since then he has been a major driver of OpenStack, the open source cloud software initiative.<\/p>","irc":"jbryce","twitter":"jbryce","presentations":[8928,13663],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/1759","gender":"Male","member_id":28},{"id":3660,"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Collier","title":"COO","bio":"<p>Prior to working on OpenStack, I worked at Yahoo! as Sr. Director of Business Development&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;strategic&nbsp;partnerships&nbsp;in the music business (via Yahoo's acquisition of Musicmatch), and previously at Dell in product, marketing, and technical roles.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">I joined Rackspace in 2009, in the role of Vice President of Business Development &amp; Corporate Development, and began working on a plan (with Jim Curry, Rick Clark, Bret Piatt, Jonathan Bryce, Jason Seats, Lauren Sell&nbsp;and countless others) to fully embrace open source in the cloud, seeking Rackspace board approval and building alliances with NASA and 25 other&nbsp;organizations. This led to the launch of&nbsp;OpenStack in July 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">After launching OpenStack, my focus shifted full time to community building activitites to grow OpenStack, as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for OpenStack. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The ecosystem and the brand have grown in concert, as new organizations that we've attracted have helped spread the word and improve the OpenStack software by hiring dozens of OpenStack developers,&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;solutions that meet the needs of users such as Cisco Webex, eBay, Mercado Libre, and Paypal.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2011, I began the work of establishing the independent OpenStack Foundation, along with Jonathan Bryce (now Executive Director) and many others&nbsp;throughout the community. &nbsp;This open process included writing and revising the basic structure,&nbsp;principles, and ultimately the bylaws in an open manner, until we launched the new independent foundation in the Fall of 2012. &nbsp;The&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;of a User Committee is one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most vital components of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new structure, IMHO, as in the end the software is for the users, and that is who we must fight for.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm now the Chief Operating Officer of the OpenStack Foundation, and work full time to achieve the OpenStack Foundation Mission focused on \"<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>Protecting<\/em><\/strong><em>,<\/em><strong><em>&nbsp;Empowering<\/em><\/strong><em>, and&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>Promoting&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em>OpenStack software and the community around it, including users, developers and the entire ecosystem.\"<\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside of OpenStack, I&nbsp;love music, Austin, BBQ, wakeboarding on Lake Austin, and basketball (Rockets &amp; Longhorns fan). I&nbsp;sometimes make angel investments but I mostly juggle working on OpenStack and spending time with my family. I usually go by \"sparkycollier\" on the interwebs, which is my way of honoring my late, great, Great Dane Sparky.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">More Links:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/markcollier\">http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/markcollier<\/a><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/markcollier.me\/\">http:\/\/markcollier.me\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>","irc":"sparkycollier","twitter":"sparkycollier","presentations":[8513,8866,8929,9467],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/3660","gender":"Male","member_id":31}],"timestamp":1475766992}
