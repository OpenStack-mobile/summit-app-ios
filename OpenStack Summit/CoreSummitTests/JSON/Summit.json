Unencrypted user data is at risk of exposure should a third party gain access to a disk.<\/p>\r\n<p>Users can of course guard against this risk by encrypting data before sending to Swift, but often a server-side encryption service is desirable. This may be because operators themselves must ensure encryption of data at rest to satisfy regulatory and\/or customer requirements, or because clients do not wish to manage encryption keys.<\/p>\r\n<p>With this new feature Swift is able to encrypt objects as they are received through a Swift proxy. This has advantages over other server-side encryption approaches: encrypting content once in the proxy incurs lower CPU overhead than having each replica encrypted on object servers using existing block encryption tools such as dm-crypt; encrypting in Swift itself avoids the cost of upgrading hardware to self-encrypting disks.<\/p>","attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>Attendees will learn about the new Swift encryption feature, how it is enabled in deployment and gain an understanding of the security threats that it is intended to protect against.<\/p>","summit_types":[9],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":884,"tag":"security"},{"id":1527,"tag":" Upstream"},{"id":3364,"tag":" Swift"}],"speakers":[2873,3741],"slides":[],"links":[{"id":31695,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":15968,"link":"Swift Encryption documentation http:\/\/docs.openstack.org\/developer\/swift\/overview_encryption.html"},{"id":31696,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"order":0,"presentation_id":15968,"link":"\u201cSwift object encryption\u201d preview presentation at Austin OpenStack Summit. https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/summit\/austin-2016\/summit-schedule\/events\/6869"}],"videos":[]},{"id":16483,"title":"Simplify Day 2 operations (and get some sleep!) through Craton fleet management","description":"<p><span>Use Rackspace\u2019s proven approach for fleet management, with inventory and audit\/remediation workflows.

This existing solution has proven itself in production: it enables us to support such needs as live migrating the VMs on 19,000 hosts, or deploying the next release of OpenStack, with minimal manual remediation.

One example is audit: operators need to know what&rsquo;s different about their environment - data that&rsquo;s not necessarily captured by asset management; nor is it reported on by monitoring\/metrics. Instead, we allow operators to craft their own audits, get results, and use that for their remediations.

We adopted Openstack because of prior exprience with it &amp; because of no other real alternate to build a large scale IaaS using opensource, with a healthy ecosystem of supported enterprise products. During our early exploration we came across many projects that failed to execute on a similar mission, mainly because they didn't embrace Openstack as opensource and treated it like an enterprise software. In our opinion the only way to be successful with Openstack is by understanding the minute details of the inner workings and code. The community is a great resource to build that knowledge but ultimately the team has to own the software.<\/p>","attendees_expected_learnt":"<p>I hope to share our learnings from building a large scale Openstack deployment ranging from the key benefits of building and operating your private cloud at scale compared to a public cloud.

Arrebol provides an intuitive scripting language to define large BoT jobs in a succinct way. Using a command line interface, users can submit jobs to the Arrebol submission service. It parses the jobs and interacts with the underlying cloud to create the infrastructure required to run them. Then, it submits tasks to execute in parallel, and dismantles the infrastructure when it is no longer needed, making the management of the execution of jobs completely transparent to the users. BoT applications are ideally suited to be executed over elastic cloud infrastructures. We also discuss how Arrebol leverages Fogbow, a middleware for federating clouds, to increase the capacity of the infrastructure by exploiting different hybrid settings, including cloudbursting and cloud federation.

This makes them very easy to execute in parallel. It suffices to implement a workqueue scheduler that keeps submitting tasks to any virtual machine (VM) that is available. The more VMs available, the faster the job will complete. Unfortunately, the number of VMs that a user can simultaneously create in a private cloud is regulated by quite restrictive quotas, compared to the ideal number of VMs required to run a large BoT job fully in parallel. We explain how we address both issues. On one side, we use Arrebol to facilitate the description of large BoT jobs, and to transparent manage their execution on a cloud infrastructure. On the other side, we use Fogbow to increase the size of the infrastructure that Arrebol can use to run jobs for its users.

This led to the launch of&nbsp;OpenStack in July 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">After launching OpenStack, my focus shifted full time to community building activitites to grow OpenStack, as Vice President of Business Development and Marketing for OpenStack. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">The ecosystem and the brand have grown in concert, as new organizations that we've attracted have helped spread the word and improve the OpenStack software by hiring dozens of OpenStack developers,&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;solutions that meet the needs of users such as Cisco Webex, eBay, Mercado Libre, and Paypal.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\">In 2011, I began the work of establishing the independent OpenStack Foundation, along with Jonathan Bryce (now Executive Director) and many others&nbsp;throughout the community. &nbsp;This open process included writing and revising the basic structure,&nbsp;principles, and ultimately the bylaws in an open manner, until we launched the new independent foundation in the Fall of 2012. &nbsp;The&nbsp;establishment&nbsp;of a User Committee is one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;most vital components of&nbsp;the&nbsp;new structure, IMHO, as in the end the software is for the users, and that is who we must fight for.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I'm now the Chief Operating Officer of the OpenStack Foundation, and work full time to achieve the OpenStack Foundation Mission focused on \"<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><strong><em>Protecting<\/em><\/strong><em>,<\/em><strong><em>&nbsp;Empowering<\/em><\/strong><em>, and&nbsp;<\/em><strong><em>Promoting&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><em>OpenStack software and the community around it, including users, developers and the entire ecosystem.\"<\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Outside of OpenStack, I&nbsp;love music, Austin, BBQ, wakeboarding on Lake Austin, and basketball (Rockets &amp; Longhorns fan).
