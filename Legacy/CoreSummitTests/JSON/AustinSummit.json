While attempting to install OpenStack with Networking (neutron) for the first time, I ran into significant hurdles from issues with the installation guide. After determining the source of the main problem, I filed my first documentation bug with a suggested patch. Several patches later, I realized that the networking chapter needed rewriting from the ground up. Working with several people on the documentation team, I completely rewrote the content for the Icehouse release and have continued to improve it along with other portions of the installation guide and other community documentation.<\/p>\r\n<p>I became very familiar with OpenStack during this journey, particularly the Networking service, and have assisted a large number of people with architecture, deployment, operation, and troubleshooting. You can almost always find me on IRC in the #openstack channel. Between support, bug triage, and general observations, the Networking component seems to cause the most frustration because most people learning OpenStack come from virtualization platforms with only basic networking features or from network infrastructures using physical equipment rather than Linux. The lack of practical documentation, arguably less than any other service, only increases frustration.<\/p>\r\n<p>During the Icehouse development cycle, people from various parts of the OpenStack community including myself from the core documentation team decided that we needed to develop a networking guide. Content development began during the Juno development cycle and continues today. Since the beginning of the networking guide project, I developed, tested, and contributed documentation for several practical scenarios for deploying the Networking service.<\/p>\r\n<p>I currently work for IBM as a software developer and contribute to several OpenStack projects including core documentation, Networking, and Open Virtual Network (OVN).<\/p>","irc":"Sam-I-Am","twitter":"ionosphere80","member_id":14400,"presentations":[7751],"pic":"https:\/\/devbranch.openstack.org\/profile_images\/speakers\/4038","gender":"Male"},{"id":4039,"first_name":"Fernando","last_name":"Ribeiro","title":"Principal Sales Consultant","bio":"<p>Professional with 16 years of experience in enterprise solution development.

The cinder team has brought up some issues [4], namely the properties vs metadata naming convention.

While consistency is a good goal, managing the list of *versions* of dependencies is a huge amount of work, especially around release time when we need to make sure all projects are synced up. There is also risk as we move ahead with the constraints system, because we don't have sufficient test coverage of constraints changes to know when those changes will break a project. As part of my push to remove self-imposed requirements that introduce more work than gain, I propose that we drop our requirement for co-installability of all services and let each project manage its own versions of dependendencies and constraints directly by relying on containers for deployment and\/or container-ish things like virtualenvs for our CI testing. However, I propose that we keep a list of packages allowed to be used, without specifying the versions, to maintain our consistency goal. Is this possible? What do we lose?

In this environment, resources are shared among numerous HANA deployments, with secure network, storage, and access control to ensure the confidentiality of customer data and operations. A custom, in-house baremetal infrastructure lifecycle management solution was created in order to deploy and manage the resources used to deliver these HANA landscapes in the cloud. However, other internal management systems also exist to manage different types of cloud environments, including virtual machines for smaller HANA systems.

Instead it's run in a wsgi container. There's lots of options for wsgi containers: mod_wsgi in apache, uwsgi, gunicorn. If you run with uwsgi or gunicorn it's typically fronted with apache or nginx. On top of this, an advantage to apache\/nginx is that you can easily forward requests on different paths to different servers, so rather than using ports for each service we can have apache accept on port 80 (e.g., \/identity -> keystone-public, \/identity_admin -> keystone-admin, \/dashboard -> horizon, \/compute -> nova-api, etc.).\r<br \/>\r<br \/>Devstack also has a tls-proxy config option which is there to put stud in front of the eventlet servers (because of eventlet server's weak TLS support).

What is the most seamless way to connect to an OpenStack-based cloud with the least disruption? In both cases, it makes sense to utilize a software-defined storage controller that is able to direct storage traffic between storage infrastructure and orchestration platforms, including OpenStack. In this talk, we'll use the open source CoprHD platform as an example of how to connect OpenStack with enterprise storage.<\/p>","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":64,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","track_id":45,"moderator_speaker_id":null,"level":"Beginner","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[260],"tags":[],"speakers":[2491,5342],"slides":[],"videos":[{"id":23502,"name":"EMC - Enterprise Storage Management for Mixed Cloud Environments with CoprHD","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"presentation_id":8966,"youtube_id":"oRDyeBtzfcA"}]},{"id":9226,"title":"Documentation: Work session","description":"Install Guide https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/austin-docs-workgroup-install","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":95,"summit_id":6,"type_id":9,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":1619,"tag":"documentation"}]},{"id":8468,"title":"NFV Orchestration - Project Landscape","description":"<p>NFV Orchestration spans lots of components and organizations.

In this session, we will talk about Magnum, Kuryr, Neutron integration and how the problem of nested container networking has been solved in the OpenStack community, it's architecture, the design, current status and next steps.<\/p>","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":56,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","track_id":31,"moderator_speaker_id":null,"level":"Intermediate","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":3365,"tag":"App Developer"},{"id":1527,"tag":" Upstream"},{"id":2033,"tag":" Community"},{"id":3368,"tag":" Upstream Dev"},{"id":37,"tag":" Heat"},{"id":2662,"tag":" magnum"},{"id":35,"tag":" Neutron"},{"id":34,"tag":" Nova"}],"speakers":[1826,546,324],"slides":[{"id":28028,"name":null,"description":null,"display_on_site":false,"featured":false,"presentation_id":7633,"link":"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/FawadKhaliq\/networking-for-nested-containers-magnum-kuryr-neutron-integration"}],"videos":[{"id":23489,"name":"Networking For Nested Containers: Magnum, Kuryr, Neutron Integration","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"presentation_id":7633,"youtube_id":"00vo2FtY54Q"}]},{"id":9174,"title":"Sahara: Future of Data Processing UI","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/sahara-newton-ui\">Etherpad<\/a>\r<br \/>","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":87,"summit_id":6,"type_id":8,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":1383,"tag":"Sahara"},{"id":1252,"tag":"horizon"},{"id":3546,"tag":"UX"}]},{"id":9190,"title":"OpenStackAnsible: Project Update - Mitaka Achievements and Newton Plans","description":"This session will be a general update of what the project does based on the Mitaka deliverable, an overview of current plans for the Newton cycle and an opportunity for anyone attending to ask questions and offer contributions for current or new roadmap items.","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":93,"summit_id":6,"type_id":8,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":3542,"tag":"OpenStackAnsible"}]},{"id":9208,"title":"Ironic: Work session","description":"Driver composition, round 3.\n<br \/><br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/etherpad.openstack.org\/p\/ironic-newton-summit-driver-composition\">Etherpad<\/a>","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":94,"summit_id":6,"type_id":9,"class_name":"SummitEvent","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[2],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":1116,"tag":"Ironic"}]},{"id":8959,"title":"NetApp - Jumpstart Your Production OpenStack Deployment with FlexPod","description":"<p>In this session, we will show how to reduce the risk and challenge of deploying OpenStack on converged infrastructure, and how to use this solution for both enterprise production and proof of concept deployments. \u00a0We will be focusing on the optimizations and specific functionalities of FlexPod with emphasis on an easier user experience, and hardened enterprise deployments.<\/p>","start_date":1461775800,"end_date":1461778200,"location_id":65,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","track_id":45,"moderator_speaker_id":null,"level":"Beginner","allow_feedback":false,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[80],"tags":[],"speakers":[1234],"slides":[],"videos":[{"id":23497,"name":"NetApp - Jumpstart Your Production OpenStack Deployment with FlexPod","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"presentation_id":8959,"youtube_id":"5YZPHc2y7XY"}]},{"id":8719,"title":"NFV for Enterprise - Are We Doing Enough?","description":"<p>NFV for Enterprise - Are we doing enough?<\/p>\n<p>Many\u00a0of todays NFV initiatives are Service Provider led and Service Provider focused.

They are also the thing within which addresses are not allowed to overlap.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give a quick review of subnet pools and then talk about how they support address scopes.  Address scopes are key to overcoming the problem of \"bring your own addressing\" (BYOA) and are instrumental in determining where traffic should be blocked or where net address translation (NAT) should be applied (or not).  This is especially important when designing your cloud for IPv6.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will briefly discuss the relationship between address scopes and two other exciting new features in Neutron:  \"BGP dynamic routing\" and \"routed networks.\"","start_date":1461852019,"end_date":1461854459,"location_id":52,"summit_id":6,"type_id":1,"class_name":"Presentation","track_id":24,"moderator_speaker_id":null,"level":"Intermediate","allow_feedback":true,"avg_feedback_rate":null,"is_published":true,"head_count":null,"rsvp_link":null,"summit_types":[1],"sponsors":[],"tags":[{"id":1419,"tag":"ops"},{"id":1527,"tag":" Upstream"},{"id":2033,"tag":" Community"},{"id":3368,"tag":" Upstream Dev"},{"id":35,"tag":" Neutron"}],"speakers":[119,4691],"slides":[],"videos":[{"id":23592,"name":"Neutron Address Scopes","description":null,"display_on_site":true,"featured":false,"presentation_id":8122,"youtube_id":"VsCYSZUOB6U"}]},{"id":7131,"title":"Win The Future: OpenStack Deployment Practice among College Students for Innovation Contest","description":"<p>In 2015, Intel took the chance of sponsoring the 8th Intel-Cup National Collegiate Software Innovation contest in China to promote OpenStack by defining the theme to be User Experience Innovation Based on Cloud Service.

The VM is capable of (1) advertising IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA) to the VMs on the internal network; and (2) IPv6 Forwarding (i.e., North-South traffic). This novel use case expands IPv6 vRouter capability to any VM and allows for any 3rd-party solution, e.g. IPv6 vRouter VNF, as an alternative of Neutron Router or ODL Router. Thus it enables open innovation.

In NFV-based networks, recovery actions will be performed by a node manager which cannot directly detect virtualized network infrastructure level failures.

We've justified this by asserting that the information we get from APIs is necessary to index, but this has backed us into a corner in some places (notably Nova).
