The Design Summit allows the upstream developer community to discuss requirements for the next software release, debate the implementation details and connect with other community members about cross-project issues. The Ops Summit gives people who are already running OpenStack clouds a place to congregate, swap best practices and give feedback in the development process. In other sessions, organizing bodies, such as ambassadors, user groups, User Committee and associated working groups, and those who are helping evangelize OpenStack around the world have an opportunitiy to join new groups, participate in working sessions, share learnings and collaborate in real-time. None of these are classic conference track with speakers and presentations, but instead collaborative group working sessions.<\/p>",
